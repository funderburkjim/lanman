19977 <head>EXPLANATIONS AND ABBREVIATIONS.</head>
19978 <head>CITATIONS.</head>
19979 <p>All numbers below 107 refer to the text of this Reader, which is cited by page and
19980 line; thus, 79^2^ means page 79, line 2. When still more precise reference is needed, the
19981 first half of a line is designated by ^a^ and the second by ^b^.</p>
19982 <p>All numbers above 107 refer to the sections of Whitney's Grammar. Observe,
19983 however, that reference is occasionally made to grammar-sections preceding § 107, and
19984 that the word “Whitney” is then prefixed to the number to show that the Grammar is
19985 meant. The grammar-sections sometimes have subdivisions unmarked by letters or
19986 numbers. In referring to these, a small superior number is used, and designates the
19987 (typographical) paragraph as counted from the last lettered or numbered subsection.
19988 Thus 330^6^ refers to the paragraph beginning “Pl.: nom.-voc. masc.”; 371^12^ begins with
19989 “From {@stṛ́@} come”; 1222^3^, with “The accent of derivatives”; 1222c 2^2^, with “In the
19990 Brāhmaṇas.”</p>
19991 <head>SIGNS.</head>
19992 <p>The root-sign (√) is prefixed to roots and quasi-roots to catch the eye or as an
19993 abbreviation. It is also set before denominative verb-stems, although these are of
19994 course in no sense roots.</p>
19995 <p>The plus-sign (+) is set before prepositions with which verbs appear in composition
19996 and before certain other elements used as prefixes.</p>
19997 <p>A star (*) signifies that the word or stem or root to which it is prefixed does not
19998 actually occur in that form.</p>
19999 <p>A half-parenthesis on its side (_) is used to show that two vowels, which, for
20000 the sake of clearness, are printed with hiatus in violation of the rules of euphonic
20001 combination, should be combined according to those rules.</p>
20002 <p>A hyphen is sometimes used to avoid the repetition of an element of a compound;
20003 thus in the article {@loka,@} p. 235, {@para-@} stands for {@para-loka.@}</p>
20004 <p>In Greek words, the old palatal spirant yod is represented by {%j,%} pronounced of course
20005 as English {%y.%} A very few Slavic and Lithuanian words occur, in which the actual or
20006 original nasalization of a vowel is denoted by an inverted comma, thus, {%e{??}, a{??}.%} Anglo-Saxon
20007 {%æ%} has the sound of {%a%} in {%man.%}</p>
20008 <head>ABBREVIATIONS.</head>
20009 <p>It is hoped that most of these, if not all, will be found self-explaining. To preclude
20010 any misunderstanding, however, a complete list of the abbreviations is given below, p. 293.</p>
20011 <p>But certain abbreviations and words are used in an arbitrary way and require
20012 more explanation than is given in the list.</p>
20013 <p>When both the letters, {%m.%} and {%n.,%} follow a stem, they mean that it shows both
20014 masculine and neuter case-forms.</p>
[Page290+ 48]
20015 <p>An “etc.” following a reference that stands after a certain definition signifies that
20016 the word is of common occurrence in that meaning.</p>
20017 <p>The abbreviation [do.] is used to avoid repetition of identical items in the square
20018 brackets at the end of articled; for examples, see the three words following {@abhivāda,@}
20019 p. 119.</p>
20020 <p>The etymological cognates are usually introduced by the conventional “cf.”; this
20021 implies that the words which the reader is bidden to “compare” are akin. The fact
20022 that two related words are compared implies as a rule only that they are radically akin,
20023 and not that their formative suffixes are identical. Thus with {@anta@} is compared English
20024 {%end,%} although this corresponds strictly only to the Sanskrit secondary derivative {@antya.@}
20025 So {@asthan,@} <gr></gr>, and {%os%} are radically identical, though not of entirely parallel formation.</p>
20026 <p>On the other hand, where it is desired to call attention, not to radically kindred
20027 words, but to words analogous only in metaphor or in transfer of meaning, the brief
20028 phrase, “for mg, cf.,” is used; and this is to be understood as standing for the phrase,
20029 “for a parallelism in the development of meaning, compare,” or, “for an analogous
20030 instance of transition of meaning, compare.”</p>
20031 <p>Specially important references to the Grammar are marked by the word “see”:
20032 thus under {@nārāyaṇá@} (p. 181), special attention is called to § 1219, which shows that
20033 this word is a simple patronymic of {@nára,@} and is not what the text (at 57^6^) says it is, a
20034 compound of {@nārá + áyana.@}</p>
20035 <head>GENERAL ARRANGEMENT OF THE VOCABULARY.</head>
20036 <p>The order of the articles is strictly and solely alphabetical (see below). Respecting
20037 words whose alphabetic place changes with their inflection, the following remarks may be
20038 made for beginners.</p>
20039 <p>All nouns, whether they be substantives or adjectives, are given under the stem. In
20040 order to know the stem, a preliminary study of the more important paradigms and rules
20041 of euphonic combination is necessary. Thus the nom. sing. {@rājā@} must be looked for
20042 under {@rājan,@} and the acc. sing. {@nāma@} under {@nāman@} (Whitney, 424); but {@nalo,@} as standing
20043 for {@nala-s@} (175a, 330), must be looked for under {@nala.@} The stems in {@ṛ@} or {@ar@} are entered
20044 in the form {@ṛ.@} The stems of the perf. act. ppl. and of the primary comparatives are
20045 given as ending in {@vāṃs@} and {@yāṃs.@} The stems in at or {@ant@} are given in the fuller form,
20046 ant, and similarly those in {@mant@} and {@vant;@} and the feminines of these and of the in-stems
20047 are not given, since they are always made in {@antī@} or {@atī, matī, vatī, inī.@}</p>
20048 <p>All verb-forms must be sought under the root. Thus {@āsīt@} will be defined only under
20049 the root 1 as (636), and not in the alphabetic place which the augment gives it, under
20050 long {@ā.@} Likewise prepositional compounds of verbs will be found under the roots (see
20051 1076), and not in the alphabetic place under the preposition. The beginner is advised
20052 to make himself thoroughly familiar with the list of prepositions (1077) at the outset.</p>
20053 <p>Of the verbal adjectives and nouns (Whitney, chapter xiii., p. 307 ff.), only the
20054 gerundives (in {@ya, tavya,@} and {@anīya@}) have been given regularly in alphabetic place.
20055 The participles in {@ta@} and {@na@} are usually given under the roots; but in some cases, where
20056 they have assumed a distinctly adjectival or substantival coloring or have an incon-
20057 veniently large variety of meanings and uses, they are treated at length in alphabetic
20058 place; such, for example, are {@ṛta, kṛta, gata, jāta, nivṛtta, bhūta, sthita, hita,@} etc.
20059 Gerunds with {@a-@} or {@su-@} (e. g. {@a-citvā@}) are of course treated in alphabetic place.</p>
20060 <p>Such adverbs as are merely case-forms of substantive or adjective stems, are
20061 generally to be sought for under those stems. Those from pronominal stems (e. g. {@kim,
20062 tad, yad@}) receive separate treatment.</p>
[Page291+ 47]
20063 <p>The pronouns of the first and second person would require a dozen different arti-
20064 cles apiece if all their forms were given alphabetically. The same is true to a greather
20065 or less extent of the other pronouns. The student should therefore learn, as early as
20066 possible, the forms given at 491, 495, 499b, 501 (especially {@ayam: asau@} is less important),
20067 504, and 509. The uses of {@sa-s,@} etc., {@eṣa-s,@} etc., and {@ayam,@} etc., are given under {@ta, etad,@}
20068 and {@idam@} respectively.</p>
20069 <p>As for compounds, they are given with completeness for the Vedic selections, and
20070 with great freedom for the remaining texts, especially for the Nala. The meaning of
20071 such as are lacking can be easily learned by looking out their component parts.</p>
20072 <head>THE ALPHABETIC ORDER.</head>
20073 <p>The order of the letters is given by Whitney at § 5 (compare § 7); but several
20074 matters which are frequent occasions of stumbling, may be noticed here.</p>
20075 <p>The {%visarga%} has the first place after the vowels. Thus {@antaḥ-pura@} (for {@antar
20076 + pura@}) stands next after {@anta,@} p. 116, and not after {@antardhāna.@} But the {%visarga%}
20077 which is regarded as equivalent to a sibilant and exchangeable with it (Whitney, 7^2^),
20078 stands in the alphabetic place of the sibilant. Thus the {%visarga%} of {@adhaḥ-śāyin,@} as
20079 equivalent to {@ś@} (172), brings this word just before {@adhas@} (p. 115, top), and not between
20080 {@adha@} and {@adhanya.@}</p>
20081 <p>The sign {@ṃ,@} as representing “the {%anusvāra%} of more independent origin” (Whitney,
20082 73^3^), has its place before all the mutes etc. (Whitney, 5). Thus in {@aṃś-a,@} the {@ṃ@} repre-
20083 sents a nasalization of the radical vowel, and the word comes immediately after a. So
20084 {@haṃsa@} comes just after {@ha,@} p. 284; {@daṃś@} and {@daṃṣṭrin,@} at the beginning of the letter {@d.@}</p>
20085 <p>The sign {@ṃ,@} as representing an assimilated {@m,@} is differently placed, according to its
20086 phonetic value. On the one hand, if {@ṃ,@} as product of a {@m@} assimilated to a semivowel,
20087 sibilant, or {@h@} (see 213c, d), represent a nasal semivowel or {%anusvāra,%} then its place is like
20088 that of {@ṃ.@} Thus {@saṃyatendriya@} follows {@sa,@} and {@saṃhita@} comes just before {@sakacchapa@}
20089 (p. 263), and {@puṃs@} before {@puṭa@} (p. 191).</p>
20090 <p>On the other hand, if, for instance, as product of a {@m@} assimilated to a guttural, the
20091 sign {@ṃ@} represent guttural {@ṅ,@} then its place is that of {@ṅ;@} and a similar rule applies
20092 to all the other cases under 213b. Thus {@saṃkaṭa@} and {@saṃkalpa@} follow {@sagara,@} and
20093 {@saṃgama@} follows {@saṅga,@} p. 264; so {@saṃcaya@} (whose {@ṃ = ñ@}) follows {@sajya;@} and {@saṃtati@}
20094 (whose {@ṃ = n@}) follows {@sant,@} p. 266.</p>
20095 <p>Vedic {@ḻ@} is placed after {@ḍ,@} and {@ḻh@} after {@ḍh.@}</p>
20096 <head>THE CONTENTS OF THE SEPARATE ARTICLES.</head>
20097 <p>Homonyms, unless differentiated by accent, are distinguished by a prefixed number
20098 (cf. {@aṅga, vayas@}); similarly homonymous roots (cf. {@kṛ@}).</p>
20099 <p>References to the Grammar in square brackets {%immediately after%} a declinable stem
20100 refer to some peculiarity of declension. Occasionally, typical cases of stems are given.
20101 Thus under {@dṛ́ś@} are given the nom. and acc. sing. and instr. dual; from these, the other
20102 cases ({@dṛk-ṣu, dṛś-ā,@} etc., {@dṛg-bhis,@} etc.) are easily known.</p>
20103 <p>Each root is followed by a synopsis of its conjugational forms, so far as they actually
20104 occur in the literature. The finite forms are given in the third person singular of the
20105 indicative, and in the order in which they are treated in the Grammar, namely, present,
20106 perfect, aorist, and future; then follow the past participle, the infinitive, and the two
20107 gerunds (e. g. {@āptá, ā́ptum; āptvā́, -ā́pya:@} observe the alternation of the accents); then
20108 follow in order the third sing. present indicative of the passive, intensive, desiderative,
20109 and causative, so far as they seemed of importance for the users of this Reader.</p>
[Page292+ 41]
20110 <p>Meanings which are synonymous or nearly so, are separated by commas; those
20111 which differ considerably from each other, are separated by semicolons or by full-faced
20112 dashes and figures ({@--1.,@} etc.). The colon is often used to show that several meanings
20113 which follow it and are separated by semicolons are co-ordinate with each other. Thus
20114 on p. 268, under {@samīpa --2b.,@} the meanings “before,” “near,” “hard by,” and “by” are
20115 co-ordinate, and are equivalent to “in the presence {%or%} neighborhood of”; cf. {@suvarcas.@}</p>
20116 <p>The arrangement for matter in heavy brackets at the end of articles is: in the case
20117 of primary derivatives, first, the root from which the word comes, with reference, if
20118 necessary, to the section giving the suffix of derivation; second, cognate words from
20119 allied languages; and third, words showing a development of meaning analogous to that
20120 shown by the Sanskrit word or illustrative of it. If the derivation of a simple word is
20121 not given, it is because it is unknown or too uncertain to be worth mentioning. In the
20122 case of secondary derivatives, the primary is given, with a reference to the section showing
20123 its treatment. The analysis of compounds is often indicated by a hyphen; but if one
20124 member ends and the next begins with a vowel or diphthong, the latter member is given
20125 in square brackets at the end of the article; cf. {@nalopākhyāna.@}</p>
20126 <p>Where words of different languages are given together, separated only by commas,
20127 the definition given after the last applies to them all; or, if no definition is given, the
20128 English word in italies at the end is both a cognate and a definition of all at the same
20129 time; for examples, see {@ákṣa@} (‘axle’), {@aṣṭa, ūrṇa.@}</p>
20130 <p>The references to the Grammar may seem too numerous; but they are really a
20131 device for avoiding the frequent repetition of explanations which would otherwise have
20132 to be given in full. It would take half a dozen lines to explain the etymology of
20133 {@manmatha,@} for instance; but the references to 1148. 4 and 1002b make this needless;
20134 cf. the references under {@daridra, śiśu, sunva.@}</p>
20135 <p>It often happens that the statement in the section referred to does not directly cover
20136 the point aimed at in citing it; but a moment's thought will show what is meant. Thus
20137 under {@saṃkrānti,@} the two references to be compared mean that the derivative suffix is
20138 ti, and that before it the root-vowel suffers the same peculiar change that is seen in the
20139 past participle. Under {@saṃyatendriya@} reference is made to 1298, which states that
20140 possessive descriptives “are very much more common than [simple] descriptives of the
20141 same form.” The real point of the reference is plainly, not to bring out this fact, but to
20142 show the beginner in what category of compounds this word belongs. So 1290 states
20143 that “other compounds with adverbial prior members are quite irregularly accented”;
20144 but the section is cited, e. g., under {@sadha-māda,@} to indicate that this is a descriptive
20145 compound (see the heading of the preceding right-hand page, 441) in which the first
20146 member is an adverbial element with the function (cf. 1289) of an adjective. Many roots
20147 form verb-stems in {@aya,@} but without causative signification; this is briefly indicated by
20148 the reference 1041^2^. In the case of secondary derivatives in {@vant, mant, tā,@} and {@tva,@} a
20149 simple reference to one of the sections treating of these endings (1233, 1235, 1237, 1239)
20150 is put instead of a repetition of the primitive.</p>
