<head>THE STORY OF NALA AND DAMAYANTĪ.</head>
<p>§ 1. The trend of Aryan migration in India has been from the extreme north-
west to the south-east, across the region drained by the Indus and its affluents, and
called the Panjāb or Land of the Five Rivers; and again south-east, down the valleys
of the Jumna and Ganges. One prominent group of Aryan immigrant tribes was
that of the Kosalas, Videhas, and Magadhas, who settled in the {%lower%} valley of the
Ganges, {%east%} of its confluence with the Jumna, in the districts now named Oudh
and Behar, the Palestine of Buddhism.</p>
<p>§ 2. Another group of tribes had their home on the upper Indus, in the north-
west of the Panjāb. Theirs was the religion and civilization of which the Vedas
are the monument. Later we find them advancing south-eastward, and establishing
themselves on the {%upper%} course of the Jumna and Ganges, in Madhya-deśa, The
Mid-Land. Foremost among them are the tribes of the Bhāratas, the Kurus, and
the Panchālas. Here arose the system of Brahmanism; here the simple nature-
religion of the Vedas developed into a religion of priests and sacrifices; here the
Bhāratas attained a kind of religious primacy and the lustre of a great name,
although gradually merging their tribal individuality with that of kindred tribes;
here were fought the battles of the Bhāratas; and here, to ever-ready listeners, in
school or forest-hermitage, at a sacrifice or a burial, were told the tales of these
battles and their heroes. These are the tales that form the nucleus of the Great-
Bhārata-Story ({@mahā-bhārata_ākhyāna,@} or, more briefly), the Mahā-bhārata.</p>
<p>§ 3. These tales were probably first circulated in prose, until some more clever
teller put them into simple and easily-remembered metrical form. The date of
these first simple epics we do not know. They may well have existed several
centuries before our era; but neither their language nor the notices of the Greeks
afford any satisfactorily direct evidence upon the subject. Around this nucleus
have been grouped additions,--historical, mythological, and didactic,--until the
Great-Bhārata, as we now have it, contains over one hundred thousand distichs, or
about eight times as much as the Iliad and Odyssey together.</p>
<p>§ 4. Only about one-fifth of the whole poem is occupied with the principal
story. This, in the briefest possible summary, is as follows. The two brothers,
Dhritarāshtra and Pāndu ({@dhṛta-rāṣṭra, pāṇḍu@}), were brought up in their royal
home of Hastinā-pura, about sixty miles north-east of modern Delhi. Dhritarāshtra,
the elder, was blind, and so Pāndu became king, and had a glorious reign. He had
five sons, chief of whom were Yudhishthira, Bhīma, and Arjuna. They are called
Pāndavas, and are the types of honor and heroism. Dhritarāshtra's hundred sons,
Duryodhana and the rest, are usually called the Kuru princes, and are represented
as in every way bad. After Pāndu's death, his sons are brought up with their
[Page298+ 46]
cousins. The kingdom devolved on Dhritarāshtra, who in turn made his nephew
Yudhishthira the heir apparent.</p>
<p>§ 5. Yudhishthira's exploits aroused the ill-will of his cousins, and, to escape
their plots, the Pāndu princes went away to the king of Panchāla, whose daughter,
Draupadī, became their common wife. In view of this strong alliance with the
Panchālas, Dhritarāshtra thought it best to conciliate the Pāndus. So he divided the
kingdom, and gave Hastinā-pura to his sons, and to his nephews a district to the
south-west, where they built Indra-prastha, the modern Delhi. Here the Pāndavas
and their people lived happily under king Yudhishthira.</p>
<p>§ 6. On one occasion Dhritarāshtra held a great assembly of princes at his
capital. The Pāndavas were invited and came. Yudhishthira was challenged to
play with Duryodhana, and accepted. The dice were thrown for Duryodhana by his
uncle Śakuni. Yudhishthira loses everything--wealth, kingdom, brothers, wife. A
compromise, however, is made, by which the Pāndavas give up their part of the
kingdom for twelve years, and agree to remain incognito for a thirteenth. With
Draupadī, they retire to the Kāmyaka forest, on the Saraswatī.</p>
<p>§ 7. For twelve years the Pāndu princes dwell in the wood. Many legends are
told to divert and console them in their exile; and these stories, with the description
of the forest-life of the princes, combine to make up the third or ‘Forest-book,’ the
{@vana-parvan,@} which is one of the longest in the whole poem.</p>
<p>§ 8. The thirteenth year arrived and passed. “Then in the fourteenth the
Pāndavas demanded back their possessions, but received them not. From this arose
the conflict. They overthrew the ruling house, slew prince Duryodhana, and then,
although losing most of their warriors, they got back again their kingdom.” MBh.
i. 61. 51 = 2280. Thus ended the Bhārata, doubtless, in its oldest and simplest form.</p>
<p>§ 9. The poem, as we now have it, spins out the story of the combat through
several books and through thousands of distichs. At length Yudhishthira is crowned
in Hastinā-pura, and Bhīshma, the leader of the Kurus, although mortally wounded,
instructs him, for about twenty thousand distichs, on the duties of kings and on
other topics, and then dies. In the seventeenth book, the Pāndus renounce the king-
dom, and in the next, the last, they ascend to heaven with Draupadī.</p>
<p>§ 10. The Nala-episode illustrates very well how loose is the connection of the
episodes in general with the main thread of the Bhārata. The story of Nala is one
of those inserted in the third book (above, § 7), and its setting is as follows. Ar-
juna had gone to the heaven of Indra to get from him divine weapons. The other
Pāndavas, remaining in the forest with Draupadī, lament their brother's absence and
the loss of their kingdom. Meantime the fierce and stout-armed Bhīma addresses
his brother Yudhishthira, and offers to go out and slay their deceitful cousins.
Yudhishthira counsels Bhīma to wait till after the thirteenth year, and is trying to
calm his impetuous brother, when suddenly there arrives a mighty sage, Brihadaśwa.
The holy man is received with honor and with the customary guest's-dish of milk
and honey. When he is seated, Yudhishthira sits by him, bewails his sad lot, and
asks, “Hast thou ever seen or heard of a man more luckless than I am ? I believe
there never was one more unhappy.” “On this point,” replies the sage, “I will tell
thee a story of a king who was even more luckless than thou. King Nala was once
cheated out of his kingdom by a false dice-player, and dwelt in the forest, and
[Page299+ 49]
neither slaves, chariot, brother, nor friend was left him; but thou art surrounded by
heroes, brothers, and friends, and oughtest not to grieve.” Thereupon Yudhishthira
begs him to relate the story at length. Accordingly, to console the king, and to
show him that there is hope of regaining his kingdom, just as Nala regained his,
Brihadaśwa begins as in the extract given in the Reader (<ls n="lan,1,3">1<sup>3</sup></ls>).</p>
<p>§ 11. CHAPTER 1. Nala was a prince of Nishadha. Damayantī was the
lovely daughter of Bhīma, the king of Vidarbha. By the miraculous interposition
of swans, the prince and princess become mutually enamored.</p>
<p>§ 12. CHAP. 2. Bhīma accordingly holds a swayamvara (‘self-choice’) for
her. The neighboring kings are invited, and she is permitted to choose for herself
her husband from them. The chief gods hear of it and determine to go also. On
their way, they meet Nala, who is bound on the same errand.</p>
<p>§ 13. CHAP. 3. The gods request Nala to sue for them. Reluctantly consent-
ing, he enters the chamber of the princess and tells how the gods desire her hand.</p>
<p>§ 14. CHAP. 4. Damayantī refuses to listen to the arguments in favor of the
gods. She desires that the swayamvara be held in the usual form, and that the
gods be present, and informs Nala that she intends to show openly her preference
for him. All this Nala reports to the gods.</p>
<p>§ 15. CHAP. 5. The gods and kings assemble. The four chief gods assume
the appearance of Nala. Unable to distinguish the real Nala, the princess, dis-
tressed, prays to the gods, and they, in answer, resume their proper forms and
peculiar attributes (see <ls n="lan,14,12">14<sup>12</sup></ls> N.). Thereupon she chooses Nala. The kings express
their sorrow, and the gods their delight. The gods give Nala the magic power of
having fire and water whenever he wishes, and a wonderful skill in cookery. The
wedding-feast is celebrated. Nala returns to Nishadha with his bride. They live
happily, and have a son and daughter.--Here the extract in the Reader ends.</p>
<p>§ 16. CHAPTERS 6-26. These tell of Nala's misfortunes, and their final happy
issue. He loses everything, even his kingdom, by gambling, and wanders, hungry
and half naked, in the forest. He is transformed into a dwarf, and becomes chari-
oteer of Rituparna, king of Oudh. Damayantī, at her father's in Kundina, is led by
certain tidings to suspect that Nala is at Oudh. By way of stratagem, she holds out
hopes of her hand to Rituparna, if he will drive from Oudh to Kundina, some five
hundred miles, in a single day, knowing well that only Nala's skill in horsemanship
(see <ls n="lan,1,4">1<sup>4</sup></ls>) is equal to this task. Rituparna gets Nala to drive him thither through the
air. Nala receives as reward perfect skill in dicing. His wife recognizes him by his
magical command of fire and water, and by his cooking. He resumes his true form,
plays again, and wins back all he had lost, and lives happy ever after.*</p>
<p>§ 17. When Brihadaśwa had finished the story of Nala, Yudhishthira, pleased,
asked him for perfect skill in dicing; and the hermit, granting him his prayer, departed.</p>
<p>§ 18. This story is unquestionably one of the oldest and most beautiful
episodes of the Mahā-bhārata. It was extremely popular in India; and to this is
due the fact that it escaped the bad influence of Vishnuism, whose adherents have
worked over the vast epic, changing and interpolating, and always for the worse.</p>
<note n="299-*"><p>The student may read the entire story in any
of the numerous translations--by Milman, Bopp,
Rückert, and others. The most easily obtained is
the very spirited English rendering of Edwin Arnold,
in his {%Indian Idylls,%} Boston, Roberts Brothers, 1883,
$1.00.</p></note>
[Page300-a+ 46]
<p>§ 19. Even the Nala, especially in the first chapter, has suffered much from
later hands; but on the whole it is one of the least corrupted episodes. Its antiq-
uity is shown by the simplicity of manners implied in its incidents--the prince, for
example, cooks his own food,--by the character of Indra (cf. <ls n="lan,14,22">14<sup>22</sup></ls>N.), and in other
ways. See Holtzmann's {%Indische Sagen,%} Stuttgart, 1854, p. xiv. Bruce has
attempted to reject definite passages throughout the poem, and has published, at
St. Petersburg in 1862, a text of the Nala, reduced from 983 to 522 distichs.</p>
<p>§ 20. The story begins at iii. 53. 1 (folio 58b) of the Bombay edition of 1877,
and at iii. 2072 of the Calcutta edition of 1834.</p>
<p>§ 21. THE METRE. The stanza ({@śloka@}) or distich consists of four octosyllabic
verses ({@pāda@}). The first and second pādas form together a half-śloka or a line,
divided at the middle by the caesura: likewise the third and fourth. The more
important rules follow.</p>
<p>{%a.%} Odd pādas end usually with a first epitrite, <gr></gr>, or antispast, <gr></gr>.</p>
<p>{%b.%} Even pādas end in a diiambus, <gr></gr>, or second paeon, <gr></gr>.
So the type of the half-śloka is <gr></gr>. But</p>
<p>{%c.%} In no pāda may the syllables 2, 3, 4 form a tribrach, <gr></gr>, or anapaest, <gr></gr>;</p>
<p>{%d.%} Nor, in the even pādas, an amphimacer, <gr></gr>.</p>

<p>--It is not known where Nishadha was.
Vidarbha, the modern Berar, is at the head-
waters of the Taptī, between Nagpore and
the Nizam's Kingdom, and about five hun-
dred miles from Oudh. The general run
of the story makes it highly probable that
Nishadha was between Berar and Oudh.
From chapter ix., it would seem to have been
north of Oujein ({@ujjayinī@}). From an allusion
in the Śatapatha-brāhmana, ii. 3. 2, Weber
thinks it is in the south (i. e. from Madhya-
deśa). These premises give some ground
for the inference that Nishadha was in the
valley of the Sind, which traverses Gwalior
State, Central India. On the Sind is Nar-
wār; and local tradition connects this place
with “King Nala” in a story whose leading
features bear a striking resemblance to those
of our poem. Finally, Nala is said, chap. xv.,
to have reached Oudh on the tenth day after
quitting Damayantī, and this time suits the

distance--some two hundred miles--very

<head>SELECTIONS II.-XXI.</head>
<head>FROM THE HITOPADEŚA, THE ‘BOOK OF GOOD COUNSEL.’</head>
<p>§ 22. The first book ever printed in Sanskrit was Kālidāsa's ‘Seasons’ ({@ṛtu-@}
{@saṃhāra@}), edited by Sir Wm. Jones, and printed in Bengalī letters in 1792. The
first Sanskrit book ever printed in Nāgarī letters was the Hitopadeśa. It was edited
by Carey, and printed at Serampore in 1803. The publication was undertaken, said
Henry T. Colebrooke, “to promote and facilitate the study of the ancient and
learned language of India in the College of Fort William.” It was chosen as the
first for this purpose because of its easy style and intrinsic interest and because two
English translations of it existed, one by Wilkins (Bath, 1787), and the other by
Jones (London, 1799). To pedagogical reasons, accordingly, may be assigned in
great part, the importance of this work: it has become important in the West,
[Page311+ 49]
because the text is so well suited for tyros in Sanskrit; and in the Orient, because
of the intrinsic value of its contents.</p>
<p>§ 23. The book belongs to the ethico-didactic class of literature, and is what
the Hindus call a {@nīti-śāstra@} or ‘cónduct-work.’ The term {@nīti@} (see this in the
vocabulary) came to have special reference to the conduct of kings in their domestic
life and in their foreign relations; a {@nīti-śāstra@} is, accordingly, a ‘Prince's hand-
book of political and social ethics,’ a kind of ‘Mirrour for Magistrates.’ The Hito-
padeśa consists of mingled verse and prose. The verses are mostly proverbs and
maxims--often of the choicest practical wisdom; and their validity is proved,
illustrated, and enforced by the fables, which are in prose.</p>
<p>§ 24. The frame in which the work is set is simple and meagre. The sons of
King Sudarśana of Pāṭaliputra<sup>1</sup> (Patnā) are ignorant and vicious. He therefore con-
vokes the wise men and asks if any one is able to reform the princes. Viṣṇuśarman
offers to do so, and accordingly takes them in charge, and relates to them the stories
which make up the body of the collection.</p>
<p>§ 25. The Hitopadeśa is not an original work, but, rather, an excellent com-
pilation of ancient material. The time of its composition has not been even
approximately determined. The palm-leaf MS. brought by Mr. Cecil Bendall from
Nepāl was written in the year 493 of the Nepāl era or A. D. 1373. And Professor
Peterson's<sup>2</sup> old paper MS. from Jeypore is of about the same age. At present we
can hardly say more than that the work is at least 500 years old. In the working
over of the material, the metrical portions would naturally be changed less, on the
whole, than the prose; and in fact, many of the proverbs can be traced back in their
identical form to works of antiquity. And travellers report that just such proverbs
are current to-day in the talk of the lower classes of India.</p>
<p>The author or editor of this collection of fables, according to the colophon<sup>3</sup> of
the Jeypore MS., was named Nārāyaṇa, and his patron and publisher was the prince
Dhavalacandra.</p>
<p>§ 26. The sources of this compilation are expressly said (end of the preface,
<ls n="lan,17,8">17<sup>8</sup></ls>) to be “the Pañcatantra and another work.” The first part of this statement
is borne out by the fact that, out of forty-three fables in the Hitopadeśa, twenty-five
are found also in the Pañcatantra. The latter work, as its name implies, consists
of five books; while the Hitopadeśa is divided into four, whose titles are given in
the preface, <ls n="lan,17,7">17<sup>7</sup></ls>. The correspondence is as follows. The first book of the Pañca-
tantra answers in its frame-work to the second of the Hitopadeśa and the second of
the Pañcatantra to the first of the Hitopadeśa. Five stories from the third book
of the Pañcatantra, along with seven from the first, are scattered through the last
two books of the Hitopadeśa. From the fourth book of the Pañcatantra only one
story, “The ass in the tiger-skin,” appears in the Hitopadeśa; and from the fifth
book, only three. It thus appears that, in the main, only the first three books of
the Pañcatantra were drawn upon by the author of the Hitopadeśa; and Somadeva,
in his Kathā-sarit-sāgara (chapters 60-64, much of whose substance is from the
Pañcatantra, i.-iii.), has followed a similar course.</p>
<p>§ 27. What the “other work” is we can hardly say with entire certainty. In
it ought to be found together--if the statement of the preface is accurate--at least
<note n="311-1"><p>From this point the spelling of proper names
will no longer be anglicized.</p></note>
<note n="311-2"><p>See Preface to his Hitopadeśa, p. i, ii, v.</p></note>
<note n="311-3"><p>Peterson's ed., p. 161: cf. p. iv, v.</p></note>
[Page312+ 57]
the eighteen fables of the Hitopadeśa which do not occur in the Pañcatantra.
Had the preface said “other works,” the problem would be easier. Thus the story
of the two giants, iv. 9, may be traced to the Mahā-bhārata, and the prototypes of
other single stories are doubtless to be found in one and another ancient collection.
Professor Peterson<sup>1</sup> thinks that the “other work” is the Nītisāra of Kāmandaka.
The identification deserves further study.</p>
<p>§ 28. The contents of the Pañcatantra have been made the subject of one of
the most important contributions to the literary history of the world by the late
Professor Benfey. His principal results were published in his {%Pantschatantra%} (1859,
see above, p. xviii, no 8), and in his introduction to Bickell's edition of the {%Kalilag%}
{%und Damnag%} (1876). The latter contains, pages VI-X, a brief résumé of these
results. The summary given by Keith-Falconer (1885, see p. 315) is a systematic
and lucid account of the history of the fables, and is the one most to be commended
to English-speaking students. Some of the most important items follow.</p>
<p>{@A.@} The Indian original. In the sixth century of our era, there existed in
India a Buddhist Sanskrit work, in thirteen chapters, treating of the conduct of
princes.<sup>2</sup> Its doctrines were inculcated in the form of beast-fables, or stories in
which animals play the part of human beings.</p>
<p>{@B.@} This Indian original was translated by a Persian physician named Barzōī,
into the Pehlevī, the literary language of Persia, by command of the Sassanian king,
Khosru Anūshīrvān, called The Just (531-579 A. D.).</p>
<p>§ 29. {@c1.@} Both the Indian original and its Pehlevī version are irrecoverably
lost; but from the latter were made two very notable translations. The first was
into Syriac, made about 570 A. D., and called {%Kalilag and Damnag%} after the two
jackals, Karaṭaka and Damanaka, who figured prominently in the introduction of
the Sanskrit original. A single notice of this version had been preserved in a
catalogue of Syriac writings made by Ebed-jesus (died 1318), and published by
Assemani at Rome in 1725. A Chaldean bishop, Georgius Ebed-jesus Khayyāth,
on his way to the ecumenical council in 1870, stumbled upon a manuscript of this
Syriac version in the episcopal library at Mardīn. Through the mediation of Ignazio
Guidi in Rome, and by a wonderful combination of lucky accidents and persistent
efforts, the existence of “the lost manuscript” was made known to the eager in-
quirers in Europe,<sup>3</sup> and at last published in text and German translation by Bickell.</p>
<p>§ 30. {@c2.@} The second translation from the Pehlevī was the {%Kalilah and Dim-%}
{%nah%} or {%Fables of Pilpay%} in Arabic, made by Abd-allah ibn al-Moqaffa, a Persian
convert to Islam, who lived under the caliph al-Mansor and died about 760. This
version was published, though not in the best recension, by Silvestre de Sacy at
Paris in 1816, and an English translation of it was given by the Rev. Wyndham
Knatchbull, Oxford, 1819.</p>
<p>According to the Arabic introduction, Dabshelim ({@deva-śarman@}) was the first
king of the Indian Restoration after the fall of the governor appointed by Alexander
<note n="312-1"><p>See his Introduction, p. 29, 43, Notes, p. 3. The
Nītisāra was edited by Rājendralāla Mitra, in the
Bibliotheca Indica, vol. iv.</p></note>
<note n="312-2"><p>Such was Benfey's conclusion. It was ques-
tioned by Weber, {%Indische Streifen,%} iii. 437. Bar-
zōī's Pehlevī version (B.) may have been based on
several {%different%} works--among them a Pañcatantra.
Indeed, from the second chapter of the Arabic Kalilah
and Dimnah, ‘The mission of Barzōī’ (Knatchbull,
pages 40-41; cf. Keith-Falconer, p. xxi), and from
other evidence (Keith-Falconer, p. liv f), this is the
much more probable view.</p></note>
<note n="312-3"><p>The story of the discovery is told by Benfey,
in Bickell's book, pages XII-XXIII, as also in vari-
ous periodicals there cited, p. XXII note, e. g. {%Lon-%}
{%don Academy%} for Aug. 1, 1871.</p></note>
[Page313+ 49]
at the close of his campaign in the Panjāb, B. C. 326. When firmly established,
Dabshelim gave himself over to every wickedness. To reclaim the king, a Brahman
philosopher takes up his parable, as did Nathan before David, and at last wins him
back to virtue. The wise man is called in Arabic {%bid-bah%}<sup>1</sup> and in Syriac {%bid-vag.%}
These words are satisfactorily traced by Benfey, through the Pehlevī, to the Sanskrit
{@vidyā-pati,@} ‘master of sciences.’ Accordingly, {%bidbah,%} which has become Bidpai or
Pilpay in our modern books, is not really a proper name, but an appellative, applied
to a ‘Chief Pandit’ or ‘Court-scholar’ of an Indian prince.</p>
<p>The Arabic version is of prime importance, since from it have flowed other
versions, which have been of the utmost influence in shaping the literature of the
Middle Ages.</p>
<p>§ 31. {@D.@} These versions are: {@1.@} The Later Syriac, made in the tenth or
eleventh century, edited by Wright, and translated by Keith-Falconer; {@2.@} the
Greek one, made about <ls n="wg,1080">1080,</ls> by Symeon Seth, a Jewish physician; {@3.@} the Persian,
made some fifty years later, by Nasr Allah of Ghaznī; {@4.@} the Hebrew, ascribed to
Rabbi Joel, and probably made before <ls n="wg,1250">1250,</ls> and published, with French translation,
at Paris in 1881, by Joseph Derenbourg; {@5.@} the old Spanish, made from the Arabic
in <ls n="wg,1251">1251,</ls> and published at Madrid in 1860 by Gayangos.</p>
<p>§ 32. {@E.@} Of the descendants in the fifth degree from the original, only two
need be mentioned: {@3.@} The Persian {%Anwār-i Suhailī%} or ‘Lights of Canopus,’ a sim-
plified recast of Nasr Allah's, made about 1494 by Husain Waiz al-Kāshifī. English
translations of this have been published by Eastwick and by Wollaston, see below.
{@4.@} The {%Directorium humanae vitae,%} made from the Hebrew about 1270 by John
of Capua, and printed about 1480.</p>
<p>§ 33. {@F.@} From John of Capua's version flowed the famous ‘Book of examples
of the ancient sages,’ {%Das bu°ch der byspel der alten wysen.%} It was made at the
instance of Duke Eberhard im Bart, whose name and motto, EBERHART GRAF Z[u]
WIRTENBERG ATTEMPTO, appear as an acrostic in the initials of the first sections.
It was first printed about 1481, and has since been admirably edited by W. L.
Holland, Stuttgart, 1860. Holland used, besides three manuscripts, two printed
editions {%sine loco et anno,%} and enumerates 17 dated editions that appeared between
1483 and 1592. Four dated editions appeared at Ulm between 1483 and 1485 ! The
great number of editions of the work and their rapid succession are the best proof
of its importance as a means of instruction and amusement in the fifteenth and
sixteenth centuries.</p>
<p>Another offshoot from the {%Directorium%} is the Italian version of A. F. Doni,
entitled {%La moral filosophia,%} and printed at Venice^2^ in 1552. This is of special
interest, because from it came ({@G@}) the English translation of Sir Thomas North,
London, 1570.</p>
<p>It may here be added that La Fontaine, in the second edition of his Fables
(1678), which contains eleven books, says<sup>3</sup> that he owed the largest part of his new
material (books vii-xi) to Pilpay, the Indian sage. The edition of Henri Regnier
(Paris, Hachette, 1883-85, 3 vols.) gives abundant references to the sources of each
fable, and is especially to be commended to those who would compare the well-
known French offshoots with the Indian originals.</p>

[Page314+ 52]
<p>§ 34. From Benfey's investigations it appears that the truest extant repre-
sentative of the Indian original is the Syriac version, {%Kalilag and Damnag.%} Next to
the Syriac stands the {%Buch der Beispiele,%} which, besides, is in language remarkable
for its dignity, strength, and beauty; upon this latter version, moreover, are based
almost all the printed ones previous to 1644. To the German version almost exclu-
sively, therefore, is Europe indebted for the wide-spread knowledge of this cycle of
literature from the last part of the fifteenth to the middle of the seventeenth century.</p>
<p>§ 35. After this account of the direct descendants of the Indian original in the
Occident, it remains to speak of the history of that original in India, and of its
sources. Whether Barzōī translated from one work of thirteen chapters (cf. § 28)
or from several independent works, the fact remains that the originals of all of his
sections may be certainly identified on Indian ground save three:<sup>1</sup> five, namely,
form the Pañcatantra; two other sections figure as a supplement to the first book
of a later recension of the Pañcatantra; and yet other sections, three in number,
appear in the Mahā-bhārata.</p>
<p>The first three books of the Pañcatantra (above, § 26) were recast by Somadeva
about 1070 A. D., in his Kathā-sarit-sāgara, chapters 60-64. Somadeva's abstract of
these three books shows that they had the same form then as at the time of the
Pehlevī translation (570). As representatives of the Indian original, the offshoots
of the Pehlevī version surpass even the Indian offshoots. These latter, as respects
their truthfulness in reflecting the Indian original, are arranged by Benfey as follows:
first, the recension of the Indian original used by Somadeva; second, the one on
which the Southern Pañcatantra (of Dubois) is based; third, the one from which
the Hitopadeśa is made; and last, the one from which proceed the common Sanskrit
recensions of the Pañcatantra.</p>
<p>§ 36. At the time when Barzōī made his Pehlevī version, Buddhism was already
on the decline in India, and Brahmanism regaining its lost supremacy. It was not
to be expected on the one hand that the Brahmans would allow a work of such great
artistic merit as the original {%Mirrour for Magistrates%} to be lost and forgotten, nor,
on the other, that they would preserve it without transforming its whole spirit, which
was that of fanatical hatred for Brahmanism. They have, therefore, omitted or
transformed such parts as showed most Buddhist animus, leaving, however, many
marks uneffaced which betray its Buddhist origin.</p>
<p>In one other way, too, the original was modified. In most of its sections a
doctrine was inculcated by means of a single fable or story, and only a sparing use
was made of inserted apologues. But gradually the means became an end; into the
main story were inserted others, and others still into these, until the main story
became a mere frame, and the result was comparable to a set of Chinese boxes.<sup>2</sup></p>
<p>§ 37. Respecting the sources of the Indian original only a general statement
can be made. There were current among the Buddhists, fables and parables which
they ascribed to Buddha, and whose sanctity they sought to increase by identifying
the best character in any story with Buddha himself in a former birth. Hence the
tales were called {%Jātakas%} or ‘Birth-stories.’ There is evidence of the existence of a
collection with that name as early as the Council of Vesālī, about 380 B. C.; and in
<note n="314-1"><p>Of the remaining three, one is shown by its
spirit of deadly hatred towards the Brahmans to be
the work of Buddhists, and the other two are in
Benfey's judgment genuinely Indian.</p></note>
<note n="314-2"><p>Pedagogical reasons forbade the retention of
this arrangement, except by way of specimen. Thus
selection ix is boxed into viii, and xv and xvi into
xiv.</p></note>
[Page315-a+ 54]
the fifth century after Christ the Jātakas were put into the form in which they now
appear in the Sutta-piṭaka. They are distinguished for quaint humor and gentle
earnestness, and teach the duty of tender sympathy with animals and even of
courtesy to them. With these stories may be identified many if not all of the
fables of the Hitopadeśa.</p>
<p>§ 38. The relation of the earliest Greek and Indian fables has been the subject
of much discussion. Wagener tried to show that the Greeks derived their apologues
from the Hindus; Weber, that the Hindus got many from the Greeks. Correspon-
dences there undoubtedly are; but the difficulty is that the earliest forms of the
fables--which would furnish the only safe basis for comparison--are irrecoverably
lost. Aesop and his fables are mentioned by Plato and others as very well known:
but whether he was a Phrygian, a Jew, or an Egyptian is matter of dispute; and
even the <gr></gr> of Babrius (ca. 100 A. D.), which tradition offers us as the
oldest extant collection, are removed some 700 years from the traditional date of
Aesop. The collection on which the common modern fable-books are based was
made by the Byzantine monk Maximus Planudes, ca. 1325.</p>
<p>At all events, the oldest extant documentary collections of Greeks or of Bud-
dhists are much later than Alexander's invasion; and considering the intercourse of
the Greeks with India after that event, it is quite possible that the influence and
borrowing were in both directions.</p>
<p>§ 39. We have seen how, under the New Persian Dynasty, and afterwards
under the Caliphs, with the spread of Islam, the Indian stories were carried over
western Asia and all southern and western Europe. But this is not all. The pious
pilgrims to India from China took home with them Buddhist apologues, which were
translated into Chinese, and wandered then to Korea and Japan. They have since
been translated from Chinese into French by Stanislas Julien ({%Les Avadânas,%} Paris,
1859). Among the Mongols, too, Benfey has discovered many of these apologues;
and through the Mongols during their supremacy these stories came to the Slavic
peoples, and even to the Finns and Samoyeds.</p>

<p>§ 41. THE LITERARY HISTORY of the Indian apologues has often been treated.
So by Silvestre de Sacy, Loiselcur Deslongchamps, H. H. Wilson ({%Works,%} London,
1864, iv. 1-159), Lancerean (in his Pantchatantra, Paris, 1871), Max Müller (On the
migration of fables, {%Chips,%} London, 1875, iv. 145-209), Rhys Davids (Introduction
to his translation of the Jātakas, London, 1880), J. Schoenberg (in the very readable
introduction to his German translation of the Hitopadeśa, Vienna, 1884). Keith-
Falconer's account is on the whole the best (§ 40).</p>
<p>The French translation of the Hitopadeśa by É. Lancereau (Paris, Maisonneuve,
1882) is especially useful on account of the full and convenient references to the
books where the analogues of the different fables may be found. This book is
intended by the citation “Lancereau.”</p>
<p>§ 42. EDITIONS AND TRANSLATIONS. The most accessible text edition is that
of Professor Peter Peterson (Bombay, Government Central Book Depot, 1887. Price
1 rupee 10 annas). It contains an introduction most helpful for reading the text
in course. It forms no. xxxiii of the Bombay Sanskrit Series. The text edition
used most often as a standard of reference is that of Schlegel and Lassen (Bonn,
1829).</p>
<p>A literal English version has been given by Fr. Pincott (London, W. H. Allen,
1880). A cheap reprint of Wilkins's translation appeared in Henry Morley's Uni-
versal Library (London and New York, Routledge, 1885).</p>
<p>§ 43. METRES. Aside from the common śloka--see p. 300, § 21--there occur
in this book several other metres requiring description. The following five are
monoschematic--i. e. the stanza consists of one metrical scheme four times repeated.
The first two are simple and natural iambic-choriambic rhythms and are common in
the Veda. The name {@vasanta-tilakā@} means ‘Grace of the spring-time’; {@mālinī,@}
‘Garlanded’; {@rathoddhatā@} seems to mean ‘Car-proud.’
{%a.%} <gr></gr> {@jagatī,@} <ls n="lan,22,11">22<sup>11</sup></ls>.
{%b.%} <gr></gr> {@triṣṭubh,@} <ls n="lan,26,1">26<sup>1</sup></ls>.
{%c.%} <gr></gr> {@vasanta-tilakā,@} <ls n="lan,18,14">18<sup>14</sup></ls>, <ls n="lan,26,8">26<sup>8</sup></ls>.
{%d.%} <gr></gr> {@mālinī,@} <ls n="lan,22,22">22<sup>22</sup></ls>.
{%e.%} <gr></gr> {@rathoddhatā,@} <ls n="lan,56,11">56<sup>11</sup></ls>.
The triṣṭubh is simply a catalectic form of the {@jagatī;@} but the catalexis gives the new
cadence a trochaic effect instead of iambic. The rhythm of the {@vasanta-tilakā@} is
closely analogous to that of the {@triṣṭubh.@} The {@rathoddhatā@} is essentially similar
to a {@jagatī@} without its anacrusis.</p>
<p>§ 44. THE {@āryā@} METRE is based on the number of morae--not on Thus:
the number of syllables. See Whitney, §§ 76-79. A light syllable counts <gr></gr>
as one mora; a heavy syllable, as two. In general, the {@āryā@}-foot con- <gr></gr>
sists of four morae. These appear either as two heavy syllables, or with <gr></gr>
one heavy one at the beginning or at the middle or at the end, or as <gr></gr>
four light syllables. In each half-stanza, a caesura occurs at the end of <gr></gr>
the third foot, and the eighth or last foot of each half-stanza is catalectic.</p>
<p>The sixth foot of the first half-stanza must be an amphibrach, <gr></gr>, and that
[Page317-a+ 44]
of the second must be a single light syllable. No odd foot may be an amphibrach.
The metre occurs at <ls n="lan,26,3">26<sup>3</sup></ls> and <ls n="lan,56,5">56<sup>5</sup></ls> to <ls n="lan,56,10">56<sup>10</sup></ls>. The scheme is:
<gr></gr>
<gr></gr>
Applying this scheme, for example, to 56<sup>5-6</sup>, we have, with the proper resolutions:

The Hindus thought that every one's destiny
was written on his brow, although invisible

written characters of some Indian alphabets,
gave rise to this belief. Now-a-days, writing
materials are placed beside the new-born
babe in the lying-in room, in order that
Vidhātṛ may write the child's destiny on its
forehead. See Shib Chunder Bose, The

about the crows (= selection viii.), and fur-

<p>--Selection ix. answers to Pañcatantra,
book i., fable 8. The Buddhist version, the
Banyan Deer Jātaka, has deep moral sig-
nificance as showing the beauty of self-
sacrifice and the excellence of loving “all
things, both great and small.” This Jātaka
is mentioned by name and illustrated on the
bas-reliefs of the tope or {%Stūpa of Bharhut,%}
Cunningham, plate xxv, dating from 200
B. C. or earlier. In the Sanskrit forms, the
Jātaka has developed into a simple story
that shows how the weak animals get the
better of a powerful tyrant, not by force,
but by cunning. Somadeva gives the story
at lx. 91-107. Compare further</p>

<head>EXTRACTS FROM THE KATHĀ-SARIT-SĀGARA.</head>
<p>§ 45. The work from which the following extracts are taken holds a rather
exceptional place in Hindu literary history, inasmuch as its date and authorship are
quite definitely known. According to the author's fancy, it unites in itself all
stories as does the ocean all rivers, and he therefore calls it the ‘Ocean of the
Streams of Story’ or Kathā-sarit-sāgara. Following out the metaphor, he divides
the work into one hundred and twenty-four chapters, called {@taraṅgas@} or ‘billows.’
By another division, independent of the one just mentioned, the work is broken into
eighteen books, called {@lambakas,@} which Brockhaus, without authority, conjectured
to mean ‘surges.’ The work contains about 22,000 distichs, that is, about one-
[Page332-a+ 68]
quarter as much as the Mahā-bhārata, and not quite twice as much as the Iliad and
Odyssey together. An analysis of its contents is given by II. II. Wilson, {%Works,%}

<p>§ 47. The concluding verses of the work were printed from new and trust worthy
manuscript material by Bühler.<sup>1</sup> From them it appears that the author was named
Soma, i. e. Somadeva, and was the son of the virtuous Brahman Rāma. Somadeva
says that he made this collection of stories to please the queen Sūryavatī, and gives
some of the facts relating to the royal house of Kaśmīr then regnant. These facts
are supplemented and confirmed by the Rājataraṅginī or ‘Chronicles of Kaśmīr,’
written by Kalhaṇa, about 1148-1157 A. D.<sup>2</sup> Combining these sources, Bühler
reaches conclusions which may here be summarized briefly.</p>
<p>§ 48. In the year 79, i. e. 4079, of {@loka-kāla,<sup>3</sup>@} Saṃgrāmarāja, a descendant of
Sātavāhana (of Śāta-), succeeded to the throne of Kaśmīr. This was A. D. <ls n="wg,1003">1003.</ls> He
was followed in 1028 by his son Ananta. Anantadeva is described as weak-minded,
rash, and impetuous, but as brave even to fool-hardiness. He married Sūryavatī,
daughter of the king of Jālandhar ({@jālaṃdhara@}). She brought him entirely under
her power, and induced him, in <ls n="wg,1063">1063,</ls> to abdicate in favor of his son Kalaśadeva.
He soon repented his hasty step and got control of the government again. Mean-
time, Kalaśa abandoned himself to every vice, and, in rage, his parents determined
to punish him, and give over the kingdom to his eldest son Harṣa. In fact, Ananta
retired with his court to Vijayakṣetra, the modern Bījbahār, in [41]55 = A. D. <ls n="wg,1079">1079,</ls>
and after two years of feud with Kalaśa, took his own life in <ls n="wg,1081">1081,</ls> leaving the power
in the hands of Kalaśa, who held it till <ls n="wg,1089">1089,</ls> when he was succeeded by Harṣa.
Sūryavatī burned herself on the funeral pile of her husband Ananta. Now since,
according to Somadeva, Kalaśa was king when the work was finished, and since it
was written for Sūryavatī, the date of the composition must fall between Ananta's
first abdication and his wife's death, i. e. between 1063 and 1081 A. D.</p>
<p>§ 49. The real source of the Kathā-sarit-sāgara is stated by Somadeva<sup>4</sup> to be
the Bṛhat-kathā or ‘Great Narration’ of Guṇāḍhya. This work, according to
Bühler,<sup>5</sup> goes back to the first or second century of the Christian era; but no manu-
script of it has yet been published. On the other hand, important evidence of its
general character and contents is afforded by the two works that have flowed from

it, the Bṛhat-kathā-mañjarī and the Kathā-sarit-sāgara. Each is a recast of Guṇ-
āḍhya's original. The former was made by Kṣemendra Vyāsa-dāsa, a contemporary
of Somadeva. Its date is not far from the year 1037 A. D., and it is therefore some
thirty or forty years prior to Somadeva's work.<sup>1</sup> Both Kṣemendra and Somadeva
distinctly assert that they translated from an original in the {@paiśācī bhāṣā@} or
‘Goblin dialect’; and internal evidence<sup>2</sup> confirms their assertions, and, further,
makes it certain that each worked independently of the other. But Somadeva seems
to have been well aware of the faults of his predecessor, and his work is a decided
improvement upon that of Kṣemendra, whose recast is only about one-third as long
as Somadeva's, and sacrifices poetic merit in the effort to be brief.</p>
<p>§ 50. Although Somadeva was a Brahman, there are yet many remaining traces
of the Buddhist character of his original, and even direct allusions<sup>3</sup> to the Buddhist
Birth Stories occur. Indeed, Weber maintained<sup>4</sup> that Guṇāḍhya was a Buddhist.
The name {@paiśācī bhāṣā@} seems to have covered a number of Low Prākrit dialects<sup>5</sup>
spoken by the most ignorant and degraded classes in many different parts of India.
In one of these dialects the Bṛhat-kathā is actually written.</p>
<p>§ 51. It remains--partly by way of introduction to selection xxvii.--to com-
plete and summarize the half-mythical account there given of the origin of the stories.</p>
<p>In a retired spot on the Himālayan peak Kailāsa, the god Śiva, to please his
wife Pārvatī, was telling her (Kathā-sarit-sāgara, i. 48) the adventures of the Seven
Fairy Kings. Unfortunately, he was overheard by his Gaṇa or attendant (see {@gaṇa@}),
Puṣpadanta. Puṣpadanta foolishly told the tale to his wife, and she recited it in
turn to Pārvatī. This made it appear that Śiva had palmed off upon her an old
story. Even on learning the truth, she was still exceedingly enraged, and cursed
Puṣpadanta to be born as a mortal. She also inflicted the same curse on the Gaṇa
Mālyavant who interceded for him.</p>
<p>At their entreaty, however, she set a limit ({@anta@}) to the curse of each, speaking
(i. 59) to this effect: “There is a Yakṣa named Supratīka, who, cursed to become a
mortal, is living in the Vindhya as a Piśāca, under the name of Kāṇabhūti. When
thou, Puṣpadanta, shalt see him, and tell him the tale which thou overheardest Śiva
telling me, then thou shalt be released from thy curse. When Kāṇabhūti shall have
told it to thee, Mālyavant, he shall be released. And when thou, Mālyavant, shalt
have published it to the world, thou shalt be free also.”</p>
<p>§ 52. Puṣpadanta, accordingly, is born as Vararuci or Kātyāyana, meets Kāṇa-
bhūti, narrates to him the seven stories of adventure in seven hundred thousand
stanzas (ii. 26), and is released.</p>
<p>Kāṇabhūti, meantime, remained in the Vindhya, waiting the coming of Mālya-
vant. The latter is duly born as a Brahman (vi. 19, 20), with the name Guṇāḍhya,
at Supratiṣṭhita (vi. 8) in Pratiṣṭhāna.<sup>6</sup> This is identified with Paiṭhān on the
Godāvarī (vi. 72), about 150 miles from Bombay, east by north. After travelling in
the Deccan, Guṇāḍhya returns to the splendid royal city of Supratiṣṭhita (vi. 24) and
is appointed a minister (vi. 70) of Sātavāhana, the king of whom the story in selec-

tion xxvi. is related. In consequence of a wager with his colleague Śarvavarman
(<ls n="lan,52,1">52<sup>1</sup></ls>), Guṇāḍhya forswears the use of Sanskrit, Prākrit, and the local veruacular.
Since he knows no other language, he is forced to keep silence, and so to give up his
position as minister. With two pupils he retires to the Vindhya, and, falling in
with a host of Piśācas (vii. 26), learns their dialect. In this he addresses Kāṇabhūti,
who exists himself at the time as a Piśāca. Kāṇabhūti tells the tales in ‘his own
dialect’ ({@svabhāṣayā,@} <ls n="lan,53,4">53<sup>4</sup></ls>), i. e. Paiśācī, to Guṇāḍhya. The hearer writes them down
in Paiśācī, and with his own blood, since he had no ink by him. Kāṇabhūti is then
released.</p>
<p>Guṇāḍhya, in order to “publish the stories to the world,” sends the manuscript
to Sātavāhana. The king, puffed up by his newly-acquired knowledge of Sanskrit
grammar (<ls n="lan,52,28">52<sup>28</sup></ls>), rejects the stories on account of their dialect. Guṇāḍhya, overcome
with grief, reads aloud to his two pupils six hundred thousand distichs and casts the
manuscript, leaf by leaf, into the fire, while the beasts stand about in a circle and
listen with tears in their eyes.<sup>1</sup> One hundred thousand couplets Guṇāḍhya keeps,
because they especially pleased his pupils. At last the king hears of the strange
proceeding, comes, and takes what is left,<sup>1</sup> namely the Bṛhat-kathā. The pupils
expounded the poem to the king and he composed the first book or {@lambaka,@} called
Kathāpīṭha (<ls n="lan,56,10">56<sup>10</sup></ls>N.), to serve as a general introduction to the rest, after Guṇāḍhya
had ascended to heaven (<ls n="lan,56,4">56<sup>4</sup></ls>), released.<sup>2</sup></p>

vii. 88.--This story is famous, old, and wide-
spread. It is of distinctly Buddhistic origin
and character--see S. Beal, {%Si-yu-ki,%} i. p. 125
and note. Benfey, Pañcatantra, i. p. 388 f,
gives a great many Buddhist and other
parallels. It occurs in the Jātaka as no. 499
(vol. iv.). It is frequently figured on Bud-
dhist sculptures: so on the tope of Amarāva-
tī--see James Fergusson, {%Tree and Serpent%}
{%Worship,^2^%} plate lxxxiii. 1, and p. 225, and
plate lx. left, and p. 194; also on the great
Javan temple of Bōrō Boudour. The Ama-
rāvatī tope dates from about the beginning
of our era--see J. Burgess, {%Arch. Survey of%}
{%Southern India%} (Amarāvatī, etc.), p. 12, 101.</p>
<p>--In the Cariyā-piṭaka, Pāli text, ed.
Morris, p. 77, Śibi appears as an incarnation
of the Future Buddha. Sakka, in the form
of a blind old beggar, asks him for one of
his eyes, and he gladly gives up both of
them. This is represented in a mural paint-
ing of a cave at Ajaṇṭā--J. Burgess, {%Cave%}
{%Temples of India,%} p. 315. Beal gives a
Chinese version of the story in his {%Buddhist%}
{%Literature in China,%} p. 31-41. And the tale
occurs in Mohammedan forms with Moses
in place of Śibi, and Michael and Gabriel in
place of Indra and Dharma (or Agni).</p>
<p>--In Sanskrit works the Śibi-story is
common. We find it in the Southern Pañ-
[Page336-a+ 49]
catantra, French version by J.-A. Dubois,
p. 173. It occurs three times in the MBh.
It is told at iii. 130. 21 = 10557, of Uśīnara,
the father of Śibi (translated by P. E. Fou-
caux, {%Le MBh., Onze épisodes,%} p. 231); at
iii. 197. 1 = 13274, of Śibi himself; and at
xiii. 32. 3 = 2046, of Vṛṣadarbha, the son of
Śibi.</p>
<p>--Śibi Auśīnara is the traditional author
of RV. x. 179. 1, and seems to be the heros

[Page336-b+ 48]
Kathā-sarit-sāgara, Tar. xvii. 137.--Śacī is a
pattern of wifely virtue, but Indra does not
requite her with equal fidelity. His amours
are as notorious as those of Zeus. Indra is
invoked with the words {@ahalyāyai jāra,@} as
early as the ŚB. (iii. 3. <ls n="lan,4,18">4<sup>18</sup></ls>). He is reproached
for his affair with Ahalyā, at MBh. v. 12. 6 =
373; and this is narrated at length in the
Rāmāyaṇa, i. 48 Schlegel, or i. 49 Gorresio.
His attempt upon Ruci is told at MBh. xiii.
40. 16 = 2262, excerpted by Muir, {%Texts,%} i^2^. 466.
Later books smooth over these immoralities
by interpreting them allegorically--see

blood. Life rests in the blood, the “vital

<p>Burnell's introduction contains an argument on
the date of our Manu text. Professor Hopkins has
summed up and criticised this argument (JAOS.
xiii. p. xxviii = PAOS. May, 1885), and concludes
that it brings us not one step nearer a solution of
the problem.</p>
<p>Bühler's introduction (p. civ-cxviii) gives a learned
discussion of the date. Of this, Hopkins makes a
résumé (JAOS. xiii. p. cxcviii = PAOS. May, 1887).
He finds Bühler's conclusions probable, but does not
think them absolutely proved by the proofs adduced.</p>
<p>The text-edition of Loiseleur Deslongchamps
(Paris, 1830) is hardly obtainable now. It is safe
[Page340-b+ 50]
to say that Jolly's robs all preceding ones of their
value, inasmuch as it is the result of far-reaching
critical studies. The principal places in which Jolly's
text varies from that of the Reader are 1. 97; ii. 11, 76,
125; xii. 23, 37, 42, 45, 90, 95, 96.</p>
<p>The general theory of the origin of the Laws of
Manu was summed up and criticised by Whitney
(JAOS. xiii. p. xxx = PAOS. May, 1885). Meantime,
however, Bühler's Introduction has put the question
in a new light.</p>
<p>The relations of our text to the Mahā-bhārata are
ably discussed by Hopkins, JAOS. xl. 239-275 (cf.
PAOS. Oct., 1883). Here may be found, convenlently
assembled, quotations from Manu in the Sūtras and
inscriptions, the legendary material about him in the
Epic, and a careful discussion of the passages in the
Epic which profess to be the declarations of a per-
sonal Manu.</p>
<p>By way of calling attention to the interesting sub-
ject of the knowledge of the Greeks concerning India,
occasional citations are given. The references to
Strabo's <gr></gr> (of which book xv., chap. 1,
§§ 1-73 describe India) follow Casaubon's paging.</p>
<p>The following introduction is in the main a brief
abstract of some of the more important points of
Bühler's introduction.</p>
<p>§ 54. The native tradition respecting the origin of the Mānava-dharma-śāstra
takes the book to be the work of an individual law-giver. In accordance with this
tradition, until quite recently, it has been usual for English writers to call the
treatise ‘The Laws of Manu.’ And this designation may still be used, provided
only it be used with an intelligent mental reservation, which takes due account of
the results of modern criticism. For in the light of critical study, the figure of
Manu, as a historical person, fades away; but, on the other hand, we find that Manu
as a name is one of the greatest and most reverend of the Hindu antiquity. Ques-
tions thus arise: Whence the greatness of this name ? What was the real origin of
this law-book, and how came it to be called Mānavan ?</p>
<p>§ 55. The word {@mánu@} originally means simply ‘man’ (see vocabulary). As
we speak of human beings as the ‘children of men,’ so the Rig-veda speaks of them
as the ‘offspring of man’ ({@mánu@}); and in this way arose the conception of a personal
Mánu, the father of mankind. He is, in fact, the heros eponymos of the human race.</p>
<p>In the Veda<sup>1</sup> he appears as ‘Father Manu, child of the Sun,’ as a holy seer, the
originator of prayer, praise, and sacrifice, and as the object of the special favor of
the gods. In the Brāhmaṇas, Manu is the progenitor of the new race after the flood.
That he was regarded as a type of wisdom, is evidenced by the ancient saw, ‘What-
ever Manu said, that is medicine’ (TS. ii. 2. <ls n="lan,10,2">10<sup>2</sup></ls>). And again, that he was an eminent
type of goodness appears from the fact that his actions came to be looked upon as
<note n="340-1"><p>For the Vedic legend of his birth, see <ls n="lan,85,15">85<sup>15</sup></ls>N. The
ancillary books make Manu the author of RV. viii.
27-31. For ancient legends about Manu, see Bühler's
{%Manu,%} p. lvii f; Muir, i<sup>2</sup>. <ls n="wg,161">161f</ls>, aud esp. <ls n="wg,181">181f</ls>.</p></note>
[Page341+ 47]
examples highly worthy of imitation. Thus the Veda says (TS. iii. 1. <ls n="lan,9,4">9<sup>4</sup></ls>), ‘Manu
divided his property among his sons’; and this is quoted by Baudhāyana in his
Dharma-sūtra as such an example. Such simple beginnings are entirely natural; but
they are also sufficient to show how, with the growth of legal literature, the authors
of law-books came to cite all kinds of (supposititious) sayings and doings of Manu as
authoritative precedent. For, after the custom of referring to Manu as authority
was once started, the oftener he was thus cited, the greater his factitious authority
and the temptation to cite him would become. Accordingly, if we examine the four
oldest Dharma-sūtras, we find much more frequent reference to Manu in Vasiṣṭha,
the latest of them, than in Gautama, the oldest. And thus, at last, what had been
a mere name, a part of the traditional inheritance of the mythical past, attained to
greatness as a personal authority and actual law-giver.</p>
<p>§ 56. Before proceeding to our other questions, let us rehearse briefly the native
account of the origin of the work. In Sanskrit, the book is entitled {@mānava;@} and
this may mean either ‘of Manu’ or ‘of the Mānavans.’ The Hindus say, ‘of Manu’;
and accordingly the opening stanzas represent the great sages as approaching ‘Manu,
the son of the Self-existent,’ and asking him to declare unto them the law. He
accedes; but deems it necessary to go back to a time before the Creation, in order
to show how he derives his lineage (Manu i. 33), and hence also his authority,
directly from the Supreme One, Brahmán. ‘He,’ says Manu (i. 58-60), ‘composed
this law-book, and taught it to me alone in the beginning; I taught it to Bhṛgu;
and Bhṛgu will recite it to you.’</p>
<p>Bhṛgu accordingly takes up Manu's cosmogonical discourse, continues with an
account of the Four Ages and of other matters, dwells on the excellence of Manu's
Laws, and ends book first with a table of contents of the twelve books of which
the treatise consists. And in order that we may not forget that it is all (or all but
i. 1-60) put into the mouth of Bhṛgu, we are frequently reminded of the situation
by an ‘I will next declare’ or the like, especially at the beginning of books v. and
xii., where Bhṛgu is mentioned by name as the promulgator of the laws in question.
In accordance with all this, the work is entitled the Bhṛgu-saṃhitā of the Mānava-
dharma-śāstra, and it may conveniently be so designated. It contains 2685 ślokas
or 5370 lines; compare <ls n="lan,54,11">54<sup>11</sup></ls>N.</p>
<p>§ 57. For the incredibility of this native account the reasons are near at hand.
First, all the passages involving Bhṛgu as promulgator of the work can be separated
from the rest as easily as a picture-frame from the canvas which it surrounds.
Indeed, the entire first book is a most palpable later addition. And, more than this,
Bhṛgu himself is cited (at iii. 16), with three others, as an authority on a disputed
point. Clearly, the later editors of the work were nodding here; else they would
have expunged this stanza. And who knows how many more of a like sort they
may have expunged ?</p>
<p>Moreover, against the claim that Manu (to say nothing of the Supreme Spirit),
was the author and the first law-giver, the case is equally plain. For the work
appeals to the authority of Manu here and there, just as the other works of its class
do, thus showing that its earlier editors at least did not pretend that Manu was the
author of the whole. Nor was he a law-giver without predecessors or rivals; else
we should not find, as we do, divergent opinions of other ancient sages cited along
with what purports to be his. Moreover, the work itself (ii. 6 = <ls n="lan,58,14">58<sup>14</sup></ls>f) admits that
[Page342+ 56]
the law is based on the Veda, the usage of virtuous men, etc.; and it plainly men-
tions (at iii. 232) Dharma-śāstras, which must be either contemporaneous, or else
earlier than itself.</p>
<p>§ 58. Secondly, then, What was the real origin of the work ? The first half of
the answer is as follows. The Vedic works, as explained below, fall into the three
classes of Saṃhitā, Brāhmaṇa, and Sūtra. Chief among the works of the last class is
the Kalpa-sūtra, or ‘Ceremony-rules.’ No Kalpa work had catholic validity among
all Brahman families. On the contrary, many of the most important old families
had each its own Kalpa-sūtra. In these clannish differences, doubtless, originated
the Caraṇas or ‘Schools,’ in which Brahman science was cultivated and sacred tradi-
tion handed down from generation to generation. Thus among the adherents of the
Black Yajur-veda, we find the family of Āpastamba; and, bearing his name, we find
not only a Brāhmaṇa, but also a complete Kalpa-sūtra in its three subdivisions
of Śrauta-sūtra or ‘Rules for the fire-sacrifices,’ Gṛhya-sūtra or ‘Domestic usages,’
and Dharma-sūtra or ‘Sacred law.’ The Kalpa-sūtra of Baudhāyana doubtless had
a similar make-up. Good editions of various Gṛhya- and Dharma-sūtras are now
accessible in text and translation. They treat<sup>1</sup> of the sacraments, of the duties of a
Brahman in the various stages of his life, as student, householder, hermit, beggar,
of the duties of a king, of the law of inheritance, and so on.</p>
<p>Now these are the very subjects treated also in the Dharma-śāstras. But there
is one great difference, the difference of form. The Sūtras are in mingled prose and
verse, the latter including both {@triṣṭubh@} and {@anuṣṭubh@} stanzas; while the Śāstras are
in the ordinary epic {@śloka.@} To a mind acquainted with the veriest rudiments of
criticism it is quite clear from their form and language alone that the Śāstras are
later than the Sūtras--a view which is in entire accord with the stanza ii. 6 = <ls n="lan,58,14">58<sup>14</sup></ls>,
cited above. The conclusion, then, that the Dharma-śāstras, in general, as shown by
their contents and form, are the outgrowth, by a very natural process of evolution,
from the Dharma-sūtras, is unimpeached.</p>
<p>§ 59. The other half of our answer is that the Mānava-dharma-śāstra, in par-
ticular, is a later metrical recast of a lost Mānava-dharma-sūtra: in other words, that it
is the ‘Law-book of the Mānavans.’ This is a particular thesis, quite different from
the general conclusion just stated; and, although very widely accepted, it is not
universally so. The theory<sup>2</sup> of this connection proceeds as follows. Among the
schools of the Black Yajur-veda, especially among those of the Maitrāyaṇīya branch
thereof, we find the school of the Mānavans.<sup>3</sup> According to the investigations of
Dr. von Schröder,<sup>4</sup> the Maitrāyaṇīya seems to have been one of the oldest and most
important of all the schools of the Yajus-period.<sup>5</sup> Of these Maitrāyaṇīyas there are
still some representatives surviving in Western India; and their Sūtras are entitled
Mānava-sūtras. Manuscripts of the Mānava-śrauta-sūtra and the Mānava-gṛhya-
sūtra are still extant.<sup>6</sup></p>
<p>§ 60. Unfortunately, the Mānava-dharma-sūtra, the link most important to
connect our Bhṛgu-saṃhitā with the Vedic schools, is still missing. The researches
<note n="342-1"><p>Compare p. 358, § 96f, below.</p></note>
<note n="342-2"><p>This theory was broached by Weber (ISt. i. 69)
and Müller (see SBE. ii. p. xi) in 1849. It was con-

[Page343+ 51]
of von Bradke,<sup>1</sup> too, failed to show any striking correspondences between the
Mānava-gṛhya-sūtra and our treatise. But, on the other hand, Bühler has dis-
covered<sup>2</sup> important correspondences between it and the Mānava-śrāddha-kalpa.
Moreover, as has been repeatedly pointed out,<sup>3</sup> the Dharma-sūtra of Vasiṣṭha con-
tains a quotation (iv. 5-8) which has every appearance of being a veritable fragment
of the original Mānava-dharma-sūtra. In this quotation we have, first, the prose
rule (5); next, the stanzas which support it (6, 7), and which agree entirely or
nearly with Manu v. 41 and 48; and, last, a Vedic passage (8) to support both rule
and stanzas. This is the arrangement usual in the Dharma-sūtras. And the prose
rule (5) is characterized by the words iti {@mānavam@} as a quotation from the Sūtra
of a special school; for works valid for all Aryans are not so cited.<sup>4</sup></p>
<p>§ 61. Other quotations<sup>5</sup> are found in Vasiṣṭha at iii. 2, xiii. 16, xix. 37, and xx. 18,
in close correspondence respectively with Manu ii. 168, iv. 117, x. 120, and xi. 152 of
our text, and introduced by the formula, ‘And on this point they quote a Mānavan
stanza.’ From this, one might think that Vasiṣṭha was quoting from our Bhṛgu-
saṃhitā. But this inference is barred by the evident posteriority of our text, as
shown by its form and by other general considerations, and in particular by the fact
that the stanza at xix. 37 is in the {@triṣṭubh@} metre. We conclude, then, that the
Mānava-dharma-sūtra known to Vasiṣṭha closely resembled our text, but was not
identical with it.</p>
<p>§ 62. Now granting all that precedes, there is a very strong inherent probability
in the conclusion that our Bhṛgu-saṃhitā is a metrical recast of the Dharma-sūtra
of the Mānavan school. More than this cannot be said; for it is not a necessary
conclusion. Its probability, however, has been greatly increased by the considerations
respecting the occasion and method of the recast adduced by Bühler.</p>
<p>§ 63. The occasion was the development (beside the sectarian schools which
studied exclusively a single branch of the Veda and the rudimentary works ancillary
thereto) of the non-sectarian schools of special sciences, whose teachings claimed
validity for all Aryans. In the old Vedic schools, the pupils had to learn the texts
of the Mantras and Brāhmaṇas of their sect, and the short ancillary treatises, on
ritual, etymology, metre, etc., called Aṅgas or ‘Limbs’ of the Veda. With the
development of these subjects to elaborate disciplines, it became impossible for a
student to master them all. He must either content himself with a thorough verbal
but unintelligent acquaintance with the texts and short treatises of his own sect; or
else he must become a specialist in the ritual, the law, or some other subject, and
renounce an extensive knowledge of the sacred texts.</p>
<p>§ 64. That this truly describes the course of things is shown by the present
state of learning in India. A good Vaidik is able to recite all the texts of his branch
of the Veda. But in order to have an elaborate sacrifice performed, there is need of
a Śrotriya specialist, who, though ignorant of the other Aṅgas, is yet a master of
the ritual. In the case of two of the Aṅgas, grammar and astronomy, the Vedic
schools possess no sectarian text-books of their own. These subjects, it would seem,
had been abandoned to the specialists at an early period. For a good while longer
the sacred law was cultivated in the Vedic schools, as appears from the existence of

[Page344+ 47]
the numerous sectarian manuals on the subject. But even in these (see Bühler,
{%Manu,%} p. lii, p. xxv, N. 3) we find mention of persons who know several different law-
books, that is, who were specialists in the law. And this fact alone would lead us
to infer the existence of special law-schools.</p>
<p>§ 65. Granting the existence of these schools, we have precisely the combination
of circumstances which would lead to the production of such a work as our Manu-
text. The schools had before them plenty of Sūtra-material, sectarian, of only local
validity, unsystematic, and incomplete. In the very nature of things, the schools
would tend to be non-sectarian, to widen their influence, and to systematize and com-
plete the work of their predecessors. And this is exactly what they have done in our
Manu-text. It is absolutely non-sectarian. As contrasted with its forerunners, it
emphasizes the practical rather than the moral side of the law, treating strictly legal
topics at much greater length. It shows the signs of being a school-book. And
finally, it aims at general validity among all Aryans. This explains the fact that
our Manu shows so little correspondence with the texts of the Vedic Mānavan
schools. The recast was the work of men whose interest in their subject exceeded
their interest in a sect.</p>
<p>§ 66. Finally, the greatness of the name of the legendary and semi-divine Manu
suggests the reason why a special law-school should have chosen the Mānavan
Dharma-sūtra rather than any other as the basis of their new manual. In con-
structing a treatise that aspired to universal acceptance, they must {%ipso facto%} with-
draw any claim thereto which rested on the high standing of the Sūtra-original as a
sectarian work. The problem then was, in accomplishing this task, to avoid too
violent a break with tradition. Had they taken the Gautama-sūtra, and recast it,
waiving for it all claim to general validity on the score of Gautama's authority, it
would indeed have been a bold proceeding to father it upon Vyāsa or Manu or any
of the great sages of yore. By choosing the Mānava-sūtra, after their silent waiver
on the one hand, they had only, on the other, to interpret its title expressly as
meaning ‘of Manu,’ when,--presto--without the smallest offense to tradition or
grammar, they had a name of unsurpassed authority to commend their work to the
Aryan world.</p>
<p>§ 67. A great deal of the recast--Bühler, p. lxxiii, thinks one half--cannot
have been derived from the Sūtra-original. The entire first book is most clearly such
a later addition; and such is likewise the twelfth book, whose classification of actions
and existences according to the three {@guṇas@} (<ls n="lan,66,8">66<sup>8</sup></ls>f) is based on the teachings of the
Sāṃkhya, Yoga, and Vedānta systems of philosophy.</p>
<p>What now is the source of these later additions ? The Mahā-bhārata offers very
many correspondences with our Manu-text. A comparative study of the two works
shows that the editors of the latter have not drawn on the former, but rather that
both works have drawn upon a common stock of popular metrical maxims (Hopkins,
JAOS. xi. 268), which embodied much of the traditional legal lore, and were ascribed
(as is attested by extant inscriptions) now to one and now to another of the ancient
mythical sages--Vyāsa, Manu, and the rest.</p>
<p>§ 68. As for the method of conversion of the Sūtra into our Manu-text, Pro-
fessor Bühler is of opinion (p. xcii) that it took place at one time, and that our text
is not the result of many successive recasts.</p>
<p>§ 69. Coming, finally, to the date of the recast, Professor Bühler concludes
[Page345-a+ 58]
(p. cxiv, cxvii) that it existed in the second century A. D., and was made between
that time and circa 100 B. C. General considerations make this conclusion seem far
from improbable. Our Manu-text is doubtless the oldest of the class of secondary
law-books, like those of Yājñavalkya and Nārada, to which it belongs (p. civ). And
again, while it is doubtless posterior to the older portions of the Mahā-bhārata, our
Manu-text--in some form or other--is probably prior to the later portions of the
great Epic, books xii. and xiii. But we do not know the time of Yājñavalkya nor
of the Epic; and at present it seems quite vain to seek for an accurate date.</p>

<head>EXTRACTS FROM THE VEDIC LITERATURE.</head>
<p>§ 70. Selections xxxi. to lxxv. comprise Mantra
(or “Veda” in its narrower sense), Brāhmaṇa, and
Sūtra. They are taken for the most part from the
Rigvedic literature (or “Rigveda” in its broader
sense). Professor Kaegi's little work, entitled {%Der%}
{%Rigveda%} (2d ed.), and described above, {%Brief List,%}
p. xx, no. 23, is recommended as a most useful intro-
duction to Vedic study, on account of its general
excellence, and, in particular, on account of the ful-
ness of its bibliographical details. It is, moreover,
now easily accessible in an English version by Dr.
Robert Arrowsmith, published by Ginn and Co.,
Boston, 1886, price $1. 65. Kaegi's book will be fre-
quently cited in the sequel, as “Kaegi,” with the
page-number of the translation first, followed by that
[Page352-1b+ 39]
of the original in parenthesis. The Note-numbers
are alike in both.</p>
<p>§ 71. For grammatical forms pecullar to the Veda,
reference to Whitney will be made when needful;
but the student should read systematically the sec-
tions that describe Vedic noun-inflection and verb-
conjugation. For the former subject, the small-print
lines of <ls n="wg,330">330,</ls> <ls n="wg,340">340,</ls> and 342 are important; and for the
latter, the paragraphs on the subjunctive, 557-<ls n="wg,563">563,</ls>
736, <ls n="wg,700">700,</ls> and those on the mode-forms of the different
aorists, chap. xi. The accent, explained by Whitney,
80-86, is important for the exegesis and otherwise.
The accent-rules are given at 92-97, 314-<ls n="wg,320">320,</ls> 591-<ls n="wg,598">598,</ls>
1082-86. The qotation of the accent is explained at
87-90.</p>
<p>§ 72. The Vedic literature is based on the songs of the early Aryan tribes
immigrant into India. These tribes were life-loving, brave, and warlike, and show
their nature clearly in their songs. But they were remarkable above all for the
strength of their religious instinct. This is a cardinal fact--the prime determinant
of the character of the early Indian literature; for that literature is one of prevail-
ingly religious content. The Veda is thus distinguished from the later literature
of the Epic and the Classical periods by its contents, and also--no less--by its
language and style. But within itself, the Vedic literature (or “Veda” in the
broader sense of the word) shows differences which serve to divide it into three
great groups.</p>
<p>§ 73. To assign a definite chronological period for each of these groups is
neither feasible nor necessary.<sup>1</sup> But it is interesting and quite possible to establish
an inner chronologic sequence among the groups themselves and the sub-groups, and
even among individual books and parts of books. To the first group belong the
ancient songs themselves, which are in metrical form and are known as the Vedic
hymns or Mantras. The term “Veda” is often used in a narrower sense to denote
them. To the second belong the Brāhmaṇas, the oldest Indo-European prose extant,
which presuppose and are dependent on the Mantra-literature. The third group
comprehends the Sūtras, collections of brief rules upon liturgical and other subjects,
which, in turn, presuppose both of the foregoing groups.</p>
<note n="352-1"><p>Indeed, to do so would give a very false impres-
sion. The periods overlap; and the styles of litera-
ture shade off from one into another--so, for
example, in the Yajurveda.</p></note>
[Page353+ 55]
<p>§ 74. A great mass of Mantra-material originated and was handed down by
memorial tradition orally from generation to generation long before the existence
of any such collections of Mantras as have come down to us.<sup>1</sup> The Mantras fall into
several different classes. To one belongs the hymn-stanza (ṛ́c); to another, the
sacrificial formula ({@yájus@}); and to another, the magic charm ({@bráhman@}). From the
stock of Mantras of one class--for example, the {@yájus@}--a certain collection with
definite arrangement became established by popular usage in a certain community,
and thus arose a Veda, for example, a Yajurveda--not a certain definite book, but
some one of many possible and probable collections of Mantras of a certain definite
class. From the same stock of the same class another collection was formed in
another community, and thus arose another Veda, for example, another Yajurveda.
The period in which the oldest hymns of the Rigveda originated may be set back
into the second pre-Christian millennium;<sup>2</sup> but this only on certain general con-
siderations--not as a matter of precise argumentation. Geographically, the early
Vedic Aryans may be referred to Kābul and the Panjāb.<sup>3</sup></p>
<p>§ 75. The Mantras have come down to us, for the most part, in several collec-
tions, diverse in form and purpose. There was, besides, more or less Mantra-material
which was never embodied in any collection,<sup>4</sup> but of which we find remnants scattered
about in various books. The great collections of Mantras are the Rigveda, the
Sāmaveda, the Yajurveda, and the Atharvaveda. The text of the Mantras forms
what is often called a Saṃhitā. To each Saṃhitā is attached a body of dependent
or ancillary works of the Brāhmaṇa and Sūtra groups: so that the oldest Indian
books are classed, first, according to the Veda to which they belong; and, secondly,
according to their character as Mantra, Brāhmaṇa, or Sūtra. It is to be remembered
that “Veda” has a narrower and a broader sense, and that “Rigveda,” for instance,
may mean either the Rigveda-saṃhitā or also the entire body of works belonging to
that Veda.</p>
<p>§ 76. The Saṃhitā of the Rigveda is a historical<sup>5</sup> collection. It consists of
1017 hymns, each containing on an average about ten double lines,<sup>6</sup> so that the text is
in volume somewhat less than that of the two Homeric poems together. There is
a purely external and mechanical division of the text into ‘Eighths,’ ‘Lessons,’<sup>7</sup>
‘Groups,’ and ‘Stanzas’ ({@aṣṭaka, adhyāya, varga, ṛc@}); but this need not specially
concern us now. Of deep historical significance is the other division into ‘Books,’
‘Chapters,’ ‘Hymns,’ and ‘Stanzas’ ({@maṇḍala, anuvāka, sūkta, ṛc@}).</p>
<p>§ 77. There are ten ‘Books’ (literally, ‘Circles’). And of these, books ii. to
viii. are the so-called “Family-books”--that is, they contain each the hymns
ascribed to a single family or clan, in which they doubtless originated, and by which
they were handed down as a sacred inheritance. Thus, book ii. contains the hymns
of Gṛtsamada and his clan. Those of Viśvāmitra and his tribe follow in book iii.;
and then in order those of Vāmadeva (book iv.), Atri (book v.), Bharadvāja (book
vi.), Vasiṣṭha (book vii.), and Kaṇva (book viii.). The ninth book is made up of

hymns addressed to the deified drink Soma. The tenth comprises hymns ascribed
to very different authors;<sup>1</sup> while the first consists of fifteen<sup>2</sup> minor groups, each
attributed to some ancient poet-sage.</p>
<p>§ 78. The general history of the text of the Rigveda was touched upon by Pro-
fessor Roth in a very instructive little essay<sup>3</sup> entitled {%Vedische Studien.%} Some of
his conclusions may be briefly stated. The assembling of the Mantras into a collec-
tion was accomplished by the aid of writing.<sup>4</sup> The first Rik collections were probably
single books and parts of books, each an aggregation of material of such moderate
compass as to be easily handled by a single collector. The small collections were
later united into one large collection, which, completed by the addition of books ix.
and x., and uniformly edited, constitutes our RV. Saṃhitā.</p>
<p>§ 79. Roth recognizes three stages in the tradition: 1. the oral transmission
from the authors to the time of the collectors; 2. the reduction from the oral form
to the written form; and 3. the transmission of the written text to us. We may
admit that in the last stage the text--carefully preserved as it was, see § 98--has
suffered no very important corruptions. The collectors themselves, however, did
not by any means write down the texts precisely as they heard them. The reciters
from memory must have recited rhythmically. The collectors (writers--redactors
or diaskeuasts) have often destroyed the rhythm by putting the texts into the
strait-jacket of the rules of grammar, and especially by writing the words accord-
ing to the later rules of {@saṃdhi.@} To the first stage are to be referred the many
mistakes which are ascribable to carelessness in listening,<sup>5</sup> and which may be called
blunders of the ear rather than of the eye.</p>
<p>§ 80. That the hymns themselves are of diverse origin, both in respect of place
and of time, is probable {%a priori%} and is shown by internal evidence.<sup>6</sup> Accordingly,
if we find, for example, two hymns involving inconsistent conceptions of the same
deity or of different deities, this is to be deemed quite natural, inasmuch as they
originated among clans dwelling in diverse regions. Moreover, after the aggregation
of the small collections into the large one, interpolations and later additions were
still made. To discriminate between the different elements that now make up the
canonical Vedic text is therefore an important problem.</p>
<p>§ 81. Again, in the course of time, and in part as a result of the wrangling
pedantry of narrow teachers, the stock collections became ramified into slightly
divergent recensions. These were called {@śākhās@} or ‘branches,’ because so related to
each other as are different branches from the same tree-stock. The Śākhās often
supply to criticism the various readings for which the classical philologist looks to
good and independent manuscripts. The community in which such a Śākhā attained
definitive authority was called a {@caraṇa@} or ‘school.’ There once existed, presumably,
many branches and schools<sup>7</sup> of the RV. The school of the Śākalas,<sup>8</sup> however, seems
<note n="354-1"><p>The orthodox Hindu conception of the hymns is
that they had existed from eternity; it recognizes no
human authors. The Hindus do not call Atri, for
example, the “author” of a given hymn, but rather
the “Rishi,” i. e. the “seer,” who was so fortunate
as to “see” it the last time it was revealed.--Müller,
ASL. p. 95.</p></note>

<note n="354-4"><p>This is entirely consistent with the facts that the
tradition in the schools was oral and by memory, and
that the open use of a written text was disgraceful.

to have gained exclusive predominance, and the extant recension of the RV. Saṃhitā
bears their name. The Śākhā of the Bāṣkalas is also mentioned.</p>
<p>§ 82. The manuscripts of the RV. Saṃhitā exhibit almost no diversities of
reading; so that, in the absence of {@śākhā@}-differences, the criticism of the text has
to rest on intrinsic evidence, and on a comparison of the other Saṃhitās, and on a
study of the RV. citations in the RV. Brāhmaṇas and Sūtras. Other criteria have
been brought to light by the study of the arrangement of the collection. Thus,
within each of the books ii.-vii., the hymns addressed to the same deity are grouped
together and arranged according to the decreasing number of stanzas of each hymn.
The same simple principle goes farther, governing, for example, the order of the
groups within a book.<sup>1</sup> Violations of the principle may arouse suspicion as to the
originality or genuineness of the passages concerned.</p>
<p>§ 83. The first written form of the text would seem to have been the {@saṃhitā-@}
{@pāṭha@} or ‘combined reading,’ wherein the words are combined according to the more or
less artificial rules of grammar.<sup>2</sup> These combinations often admit of several different
resolutions. To obviate the resulting uncertainties, there was constructed the {@pada-@}
{@pāṭha@} or ‘word-reading,’ which aims to give each word in its true independent form
without reference to any rules of combination. The Pada-text of the published RV.
is attributed to Śākalya,<sup>3</sup> and is the oldest conscious exegetical work upon the Veda
now known. It is far from infallible.<sup>4</sup> For its secondary use, see § 98N.</p>
<p>§ 84. The Sāmaveda is a Veda of {@sā́mans.@} A {@sāman@} is properly a ‘tune’--
not a text; but in this connection the word means an {@ṛc@} so modified<sup>5</sup> as to be better
adapted for chanting, especially during the ceremonies of the Soma-sacrifice. Of
the 1549 stanzas of the Sāmaveda, 1474 occur also in the Rigveda.<sup>6</sup> The SV.
exhibits many variations from the readings of the RV. Saṃhitā, some of which
are of value for the criticism of the latter text.<sup>7</sup> In general, the relations of the
SV. to the RV. still present many difficult problems.<sup>8</sup></p>
<p>§ 85. The Saṃhitā of the Atharvaveda, as compared with that of the RV.,
represents a lower plane of life and thought, as it is also later in respect of form
and language. It contains magic incantations for the warding off of the most
diverse malign influences, and prayers and charms for success in the various affairs
of life, as love, gaming, quarrels, journeys, and the like. It has a high degree of
interest for the student of popular superstitions. The Saṃhitā has come down to us
in at least two recensions. The one is called the Paippalāda Śākhā.<sup>9</sup> The other was
published in 1856 by Roth and Whitney.<sup>10</sup> About a sixteenth part of the RV. stanzas
occur also--with more or less interesting variants--in books i. to xix. of this text.

formulas (see {@yajus@} in vocab.) which accompanied the sacrificial ceremonials, and
are, as it were, the hand-books of the {@adhvaryus@} or priests who did the actual
manual labor of the sacrifices.<sup>1</sup> With the growth of ritualism and its spread over
a wide extent of territory<sup>2</sup> there naturally grew up many differing usages in con-
nection with the sacrifice, and many centres of ritualistic study.<sup>3</sup> In this wise it
happened that the sectarian schools of the Yajurveda were especially numerous and
flourishing.</p>
<p>§ 87. The Black Yajurveda. The various schools of this, the older Yajurveda,
bear the names of men reputed to be the pupils--directly or indirectly--of Vaiśam-
pāyana, a name great in the Epos. At least five schools<sup>4</sup> possessed special Saṃhitās,
of which four are still extant: to wit, the Saṃhitā of the Kaṭhas (<gr></gr>) or the
Kāṭhaka; that of the Kapiṣṭhala-Kaṭhas (<gr></gr>); that of the Maitrāyaṇīyas;
and that of the school of Āpastamba, a subdivision of the Taittirīyas. The one last
mentioned, the Taittirīya Saṃhitā, was the first to be printed in a scholarly edition.<sup>5</sup>
The Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā has recently been published by Dr. L. von Schröder, Leip-
zig, 1881-86. The others are still unedited. In all these texts of the old Yajus
Saṃhitās, the sacred formulas are commingled with prose passages, explanatory and
prescriptive. A single such passage is a {@Brā́hmaṇa,<sup>6</sup>@} ‘the dictum of a {@brahmán@} {%or%}
priest,’ ‘a priestly discourse.’</p>
<p>§ 88. The White Yajurveda. To remedy this confusion, a new school of
Adhvaryus, called the Vājasaneyins, arranged a Saṃhitā of ‘clear formulas’ ({@śuklāni@}
{@yajūṃṣi@}), i. e. a text in which the formulas or Mantras were separated from the
priestly discourses or Brāhmaṇas.<sup>7</sup> Not without some little animus, doubtless, they
turned to account the double meaning of {@śukla,@} ‘clear’ or ‘white,’ and fixed the
name of “Dark” ({@kṛṣṇa,@} ‘dark’ or ‘black’) upon the mingled or uncleared texts of
their older rivals. The Saṃhitā of the White Yajurveda or Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā has
come down to us in the recension of the Kāṇvas and in that of the Mādhyaṃdinas,<sup>8</sup>
and was published by Weber, Berlin, 1849-52.</p>
<p>§ 89. The separate collections of the formulas naturally suggested a similar
treatment of the priestly discourses. In the school of the Vājasaneyins, the result
of this treatment was a collection of the formerly detached {@Brā́hmaṇas,@} which collec-
tion is itself also called a {@Brā́hmaṇa,<sup>9</sup>@} and is practically an encyclopedic digest of the
wisdom of their school.<sup>10</sup></p>
<p>§ 90. The oldest collection of Mantras, the Rigveda, is in the main the reflex
of the life of a vigorous, active, and healthy people--a people that prayed most for
length of days, for sturdy sons, abundant cattle, doughty retainers, and victory over
their enemies; a people whose religion was a simple worship of the deified powers
of nature. But even during the Vedic period, there comes a profound change. The
Yajurveda represents a turning-point in the development of the Hindu character.
The centre of Vedic life is shifted to Madhyadeśa; and here were made the first

great advances in the arts and institutions of civilization, in trade, and in science.
Here also priestly families and warrior-families attained to such importance as to
assert their independence of the people, and so bring about the strongly marked
class-distinctions that grew into the rigid system of caste. And here, with the
waxing power of the priesthood, the old Vedic religion was converted into an
infinitely complex system of sacrifices and ceremonies. To this period belongs the
belief in metempsychosis--a dreadful and universal reality to the Hindu mind.
With the growing tendency of the Hindu character towards introspection comes the
system of hermit-life and the asceticism which are so prominent in the Hindu
Middle Age, and which in turn led naturally to the habit of theosophic speculation.
The sultry air of Ganges-land has relaxed both the physical and the mental fibre of
the Hindu, and he has become a Quietist.</p>
<p>§ 91. The Hindu character has been transformed almost beyond recognition.
The change is wonderful. It would be also incomprehensible, but for the literature
of the Brāhmaṇas.<sup>1</sup> As a whole and by themselves, they are puerile, arid, inane.
But as the sole and faithful reflex of an immensely important phase in the develop-
ment of an ethnic type, they have a great interest--an interest heightened by the
fact that the annals of human evolution hardly present another type whose history
can be studied through so many centuries in unbroken continuity.</p>
<p>§ 92. The sacerdotal class, ever magnifying its office, has invested the sacrifice
with a most exaggerated importance and sanctity. The sacrifice has become the
central point of the Brahman's life and thought. About it he has spun a flimsy web
of mystery, and in each of its events he sees a hidden symbolism.<sup>2</sup> Everything is
not only that which it {%is%} but also that which it {%signifies.%} So lost is the Brahman in
these esoteric vagaries that to him the line of demarcation between “is” and “signi-
fies” becomes almost wholly obliterated.<sup>3</sup> What we deem the realities of life are as
pale shadows. The sacrifice and its events are the real facts, and to fathom their
mysteries<sup>4</sup> is omnipotence and salvation.</p>
<p>§ 93. It must not be forgotten that the phases of development represented by
the Mantras and Brāhmaṇas are not separated by hard and fast lines. The oldest
Yajus texts are of the transition type. They are called Saṃhitās, and contain
indeed Mantras in abundance; but the Mantras are mingled with prose passages
which are the first Brāhmaṇas. Descriptions of the sacrificial ceremonies, attribu-
tions to them of hidden meanings, accounts of their origin, legends to illustrate their
efficacy--such are the contents of the older Brāhmaṇas. Conscious philosophic
speculation plays a subordinate part: its beginnings we can trace to the RV.
Saṃhitā;<sup>5</sup> but the great mass of it is contained in the later Brāhmaṇa literature.</p>
<p>§ 94. In this, the later Brāhmaṇa period, the descriptions of the ritual are
relegated to systematic treatises (§ 95); and the theosophic and philosophic passages
become more lengthy and important, and receive--as containing material appro-
priate for the meditations of the <gr></gr> or Forest-hermits--the special names of
Āraṇyakas<sup>6</sup> or ‘Forest-treatises’ and Upaniṣads.<sup>7</sup> Some of the best of these have

been handed down by tradition as separate works with separate names; and other
tracts of the same general style and contents have been written; but it must be
remembered that the original Āraṇyakas and Upaniṣads were integral parts of the
digested Brāhmaṇas.<sup>1</sup></p>
<p>Brahmanical speculation culminates in pessimistic Pantheism, in the doctrine of
the misery of all earthly existence, from which we can hope for redemption only
through reabsorption into the universal All-in-One. This is the result of Brahmanical
thought, on which as a foundation was built up the doctrine and order of Buddha;
this the link that unites the Brahmanic and the Buddhistic chains of development.<sup>2</sup></p>
<p>§ 95. The Brāhmaṇas presuppose a thorough acquaintance with the course and
details of the sacrifice, and do not undertake a systematic exposition thercof. But
when the ceremonies had grown to tremendous length and complexity, it became
necessary to have manuals giving full and orderly directions for the use of the
celebrant. Such works are the ‘Rules for the sacrifices’ or Śrauta-sūtras, so called
because they stand in most intimate relation to the Veda or ‘sacred texts’ ({@śruti@}),
and continually cite these texts, and prescribe the manner and the occasions of their
employment with the various ceremonies.</p>
<p>§ 96. Usage and observance, crystallized into sacred ceremony, invest the whole
life of an Aryan Hindu--nay, even his pre-natal and post-mortem existence. These
usages differed considerably in different localities, and in the lesser details among
the different families of the same locality. In part, perhaps, to counteract the
tendency to diversity, books were made describing the observances recognized as
normal in a certain school or community. They are called Gṛhya-sūtras, or ‘Rules
of domestic usages.’ Here, too, as well as in the sacrifice, everything proceeds with
the recitation of Mantras; so that these books also attach themselves to certain
Vedas or Vedic schools. The legitimate subjects of these Rules are the ‘Sacraments’
({@saṃskāras@}), and the ‘Simple-sacrifices’ ({@pāka-yajñas@}) of the householder.</p>
<p>§ 97. There is also a third class of Sūtras, called Dharma-sūtras, which pre-
scribe rules for the every-day life of those who would conform to the example of the
virtuous. Since they have to do with ‘agreement-conduct,’ i. e. the ‘conduct’ ({@ācāra@})
which has for its norm the ‘agreement’ ({@sam-aya,@} lit. ‘con-vention’) of those who
know the law, they are also called Sāmayācārika-sūtras. The matters belonging
more properly to the Gṛhya-sūtras are sometimes treated also in the Dharma-sūtras.
But the legitimate subjects of the latter are far more varied than those of the former.
They embrace all sorts of injunctions and restrictions relating to etiquette, to
eating and sleeping, to purification and penance, and to the details of the daily life
of the student and householder and hermit, and even extend to the duties of the
king and to the beginnings of civil and criminal law. In the order of development
they are plainly posterior to the Gṛhya-sūtras.</p>
<p>§ 98. As the sacred texts of the Mantras grew in sanctity, their dialect and
style of thought became obsolescent. For the transmission of the sacred lore, a
learned apparatus became necessary. To preserve the written text of a given
‘branch’ ({@śākhā@}) of the Veda from any change in “one jot or one tittle,” by
establishing the relations of the {@saṃhitā@} and {@pada pāṭhas@} (§ 83) of that branch,
there were composed the phonetic treatises, which, because attaching each ‘to a

(certain) branch’ ({@prati-śākham@}), are called Prātiśākhyas.<sup>1</sup> These give with the
utmost minuteness of detail the rules for the retroversion of the {@pada@} to the {@saṃhitā@}

<p>§ 99. To preserve the knowledge of the sense of obsolescent words, there were
made collections of synonyms and of hard words (<gr></gr>), called the Nighaṇṭavas, the
oldest Vedic Glossary. Upon the Glossary there was written, by the ancient sage
Yāska, a comment called Nirukta, which is the oldest extant work of formal Vedic
exegesis, but which itself acknowledges a number of predecessors. Among its
successors, the most famous is the great commentary of Sāyaṇa<sup>3</sup> Ācārya, ca. 1350 A. D.
The Anukramaṇīs are little works which give the divinity, the “seer,” and the
metre of each hymn of a Saṃhitā.</p>

<p>§ 100. It remains to give a brief bibliography of the literature of the Rigveda
Saṃhitā with mention of the principal ancillary works appertaining to it. For the
bibliography of the other Saṃhitās, reference may be made to Kaegi, notes 8-26,

<p>{@1. Rigveda. Saṃhitā. a.@} Text-editions. The
first complete edition was issned by Aufrecht, 1861-
63, as vol's vi. and vii. of the ISt. Müller's great
six-volumed quarto, with the full Saṃhitā and Pada
texts, Sāyaṇa's commentary, an index, etc., was
begun in 1849 and completed in 1874. Then came
the editions mentioned at the beginning of this
Reader, in the {%Brief List,%} no's 11 and 12.</p>
<p>{@b.@} Exegesis. The greatest achievements in Vedic
exegesis must be ascribed to Roth. They are con-
tained principally in the St. Petersburg Lexicon,
{%Brief List,%} no. 5. Grassmann's Dictionary and his
Translation are described in the {%List,%} no's 13 and 14.
Professor Alfred Ludwig of Prague has published a
large work in five volnmes (Prag, Tempsky, 1876-83),
entitled {%Der Rigveda.%} Vol's i. and ii. contain a
translation of the hymns arranged according to deities
and subjects. Vol. iii. contains an introduction to
the translation, entitled {%Die Mantra-litteratur und%}
{%das alte Indien.%} Vol's iv. and v. contain a com-
mentary on the translation.</p>
<p>{@c.@} General Works. Abel Bergaigne's work en-
titled {%La religion védique%} (Paris, Vieweg, 1878-83.
3 vol's) is a systematic and encyclopedic exposition
of the religious and mythological conceptions of the
RV. The work of Geldner and Kaegi ({%List,%} no. 15),
and those of Weber, Zimmer, and the rest (no's 21-
26), all bear more or less directly on the study of the
Veda. Whitney's {%Oriental and Linguistic Studies%}
(New York, Scribner, Armstrong, & Co. 1st series,
1873) contain among other things valuable essays on
the history, interpretation, and contents of the RV.
Very recently has appeared a book by L. von Schrö-
der, {%Indiens Literatur und Cultur in historischer%}
{%Entwicklung%} (Leipzig, 1887), the first third of which
is devoted to the Veda, and especially to the period
of the Yajurveda.</p>
<p>{@2. Rigveda. Brāhmaṇas etc.@} The Aitareya
Brāhmaṇa was edited by Aufrecht--see {%List,%} no. 16.

Haug had already published the text with a trans-
lation (Bombay, 1863), criticised and corrected by
Weber, 1St. ix. 177-380.</p>
<p>The Aitareya Āraṇyaka is associated with the
Brāhmaṇa of the same name. It has five books and
was edited with Sāyaṇa's comment by R. Mitra in
the {%Bibliotheca Indica,%} 1876. See SBE. i. p. xci f.</p>
<p>Aitareya Upaniṣad is the name borne by certain
parts of the Āraṇyaka, viz. book ii., chap's 4, 5, 6--
see SBE. i. p. xcvi. The text was edited and trans-
lated by Röer, BI., 1849-53. Müller gives another
translation, SBE. i. <ls n="wg,200">200f</ls>.</p>
<p>The Śāṅkhāyana or Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa was
edited by Bruno Lindner (Jena, Costenoble, 1887).
A translation is soon to follow.</p>
<p>The Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa Upaniṣad was edited
(with Śaṃkara's comment) and translated by Cowell,
BI., 1861. Another translation, by Müller, SBE.

<p>Śānkhāyana's Śrauta-sūtra was edited by Alfred

<p>No Dharma-sūtra is certainly known to be attached
especially to the RV. Saṃhitā.</p>
<p>The RV. Prātiśākhya was edited by Regnier (JA.,
1856-58), and by Müller (Leipzig, 1856-69). Each
editor gives a translation.</p>
<p>The Nirukta, with the Nighaṇṭavas, was edited
and elucidated by Roth (Göttingen, 1848-52).</p>
<p>The Anukramaṇī of Kātyāyana was edited with

It is still used in India, at the Midday Ser-
vice. It was made the text of a linguistic-
mythological comment of 225 pages by W.
Sonne, KZ. vol's xii.-xv. !</p>
<p>In the textus receptus, the hymn has 13
stanzas. I have given only 1-9. In the
first strophe, stanzas 1-3, the god is men-
tioned only in the 3d person. In the second
strophe, he is addressed in the 2d person;
and so also in the third strophe, excepting
--as often--the final stanza (9).</p>
<p>--That stanzas 10-13 are later additions is
proved by their contents and language and
their (differing) metre. This proof is con-
firmed by the fact that the corresponding
passage of the AV., xiii. 2. 16-24, has only
stanzas 1-9; and also by the fact that only
1-9 are prescribed to be used in the ritual--

xxxix. 60-65. The hymn is the first of a col-
lection of eight Marut hymns (165-172),
concerning whose arrangement, see Olden-
berg, l. c. We have here the beginnings of
poetry in epic-dramatic form--cf. Preface,
p. iv, note 7. This hymn has been admi-
rably translated by Roth, ZDMG. xxiv. 302
(or {%Siebenzig Lieder,%} p. 84); English version
by Whitney, {%North American Review,%} 1871,
cxiii. 182 = OLSt. i. 144. It is also translated
with comments by Max Müller, {%RV. Sanhita,%}
{%translated,%} etc., i. <ls n="wg,162">162f</ls>. I give the “story of
the hymn” abridged from Roth-Whitney.</p>
<p>STANZAS 1-2. The poet inquires whither
[Page364-b+ 50]
the Maruts are going and how they are to
be detained at the sacrifice. The implicit
answer is ‘With praise.’ This then is accom-
plished in the dialogue, where, although
greatest glory is given to Indra, the god in
turn lauds them generously.</p>
<p>STANZAS 3-4. The Maruts ask why Indra
is going alone, without them, his usual com-
panions. --Indra answers evasively that he
is on the way to a sacrificial feast.</p>
<p>STANZAS 5-6. The Maruts are eager to
go with him. --He retorts that they were
not so eager when he went, alone, and slew
the dragon.</p>
<p>STANZAS 7-8. The Maruts remind him
that they {%have%} helped him do great things
and {%can%} be most useful allies in the future.
--Not inclined to share his glory with them,
he boasts again of his exploits.</p>
<p>STANZAS 9-12. The Maruts acknowledge
his might this time without reserve and to
his satisfaction. --Indra, vaunting himself
once more (10), thanks them for their hom-
age (11), and declares that the sight of them
delights his heart (12).</p>
<p>STANZAS 13-15. The poet (Agastya) turns
to the Maruts directly and asks them to
recognize and reward his skill and devotion.</p>

This entire final stanza recurs at the end of

twenty subsequent hymns.</p>

inhale pure air and retain it in his lungs for
a while. The worshipper then utters RV.
iii. 62. 10, which--like the Lord's Prayer
among Christians and like the Fātihah
among Muhammadans--takes precedence
of all other forms of supplication. [Cf.
Manu ii. <ls n="wg,101">101f</ls>.] Later on, the {@gāyatrī@} is
muttered 108 times with the help of a rosary
of Tulsī wood.</p>
<p>--Much has been fabled about the stanza
and its virtues. See, for example, Manu
ii. 77-83. And it recurs frequently in the
other Vedas; thus, four times in the VS.,
twice in the TS., and once in the SV. “No
good and sufficient explanation of the pe-
culiar sanctity attaching to this verse has
ever been given.”--Whitney, reprinted in
Kaegi, N. 222. The stanza has naturally been
imitated a great deal: so even in the RV.
(v. 82) we find verses run in the same mould.
And it is interesting to find the RV. stanzas
iii. 62. 10 ({@gāyatrī@}) and v. 82. 1 repeated in
juxtaposition in the Taittirīya {@āraṇyaka@} at
i. 11. 2 and i. 11. 3. After the pattern of the
{@gāyatrī@} have been made a good many wooden

<p>SELECTION XXXVII. RV. iv. 42. Indra
contests the supremacy of Varuṇa.--Re-
specting Varuṇa, see Hillebrandt, {%Varuṇa%}
{%und Mitra,%} 1877, and Kaegi, p. 61 (85), notes
<ls n="wg,241">241f</ls>. This hymn has ten stanzas; but the
last three have nothing to do with the rest.</p>
<p>--Varuṇa is by far the noblest and loftiest
character of the Vedic pantheon, and seems
to have held the most prominent position in
the earliest period. Later--as appears if
we consider the RV. as a whole--the war-
like and national god Indra is plainly most
prominent. The gradual supersession of
Varuṇa by Indra<sup>1</sup> is reflected in a consider-
able number of passages--among them, this
hymn--and especially in x. 124.</p>
<p>--In stanzas 1-4 of this hymn, Varuṇa
claims the godhead, supreme and from the
beginning, in virtue of his creating and sus-
taining the world.--Indra responds (5-6)
by asserting his irresistible might as god
of battle.--And the hymn ends with an
acknowledgment on the part of the poet
(st. 7) of the claims of Indra. This is essen-
tially the interpretation of most of the
authorities.<sup>2</sup></p>
<p>--But the general drift of the hymn has
been--no less than its details--the subject
of very much discussion and difference of
opinion. Bergaigne<sup>3</sup> considers stanzas 1-6
as a monologue of Indra. Barth<sup>4</sup> rejects
the theory of the decadence of the Varuṇa-
cultus and regards RV. x. 124 as one of the
few survivals of a class of myths in which
Varuṇa is not the god of a smiling and
gracious heaven, but a malignant divinity.
Finally, Whitney urges that this is not a
question of supremacy and subordination,
but rather of comparative prominence.--

<p>SELECTION XXXIX. RV. v. 24. To Agni.
--The stanzas are {@dvipada,@} i. e. consist of
two pādas, one of 8 and one of 11 or 12
syllables. Most nearly like this hymn in
metre is RV. x. 172; but the stanzas of RV.
viii. 12, 13, 15, and 18 are essentially similar
(8 + 8 + 12).</p>
<p>--It is very worthy of note that three of
the stanzas occur in immediate juxtaposition
in the other {@saṃhitās,@} and as follows: in
the order 1, 2, 4, at SV. ii. 457, 458, 459, at
VS. xv. 48<sup>a</sup>, 48<sup>b</sup>, 48<sup>c</sup>, and at VS. iii. 25<sup>a</sup>, 25<sup>b</sup>, 26<sup>a</sup>
(here stanza 3 follows as 26<sup>b</sup>); and in the
order 1, 4, 2 at TS. i. 5. 6 and iv. 4. 4. Finally,
to judge from the legend given below, and
from the prescriptions of the ritual--of the
sacrifice to the Manes, for example--this
hymn would appear to be a {@tṛca@} or triad of
riks (see Sāyaṇa to RV. v. 24 and to PB.
xiii. 12. 5).</p>
<p>--Tradition (Kātyāyana) ascribes this
hymn and also x. 57-60 to the Gaupāyana
brothers, Bandhu, Subandhu, Śrutabandhu,
and Viprabandhu. In his comments to x.
57-60, Sāyaṇa gives the pertinent legendary
material taken from ancient sources; and
this, with other matter, is given in transla-
tion, in JRAS. NS. ii. <ls n="wg,441">441f</ls>, by Max Müller,
who discusses the legend at length.</p>
<p>--The Bṛhaddevatā says that king Asa-
māti sent away the four brothers who were
his priests, and put in their stead two Brah-
man wizards. These took shape as doves,
bewitched Subandhu, and plucked out his
soul. In order to cause the spirit to return,
[Page369-a+ 48]
the {%three%} remaining brothers recited x. 58 etc.,
and ‘praised Agni with the {@dvipada@} hymn
as it is among the Atris,’ i. e. in the book of
the family of Atri, the fifth. Then Agni
gave back to Subandhu his soul, and the
brothers, delighted, sang the rest of x. 60
(7-12) and laid their hands (cf. <ls n="lan,91,2">91<sup>2</sup></ls>N.) on the

<p>SELECTION XL. RV. v. 40. Indra and
Atri, and the sun eclipsed by the demon.--
For a critical analysis of the hymn, see
Grassmann, Translation, i. 190 and esp. 540.
Stanzas 6, 7, 8, here given, are quite inde-
pendent of the rest.</p>
<p>--Ludwig identifies the eclipse here re-
ferred to with that of April 20, 1001 B. C.,
O. S.--see {%Sitzungsberichte d. böhmischen%}
{%Gesell. d. Wiss.,%} 1885. His argument is
reported by Whitney, JAOS. xiii. p. lxi f =
PAOS. Oct. 1885, and by Bergaigne, JA.
8. vi. <ls n="wg,372">372f</ls>. No fair interpretation of the text
furnishes data precise enough for an exact
identification.</p>
<p>--Stanzas 6 and 8 are spoken by the poet;
stanza 7, by the Sun. The Sun's foe, Súar-
bhānu (accent !), is ‘he who has the sun's
beams,’ and is later identified with Rāhu,
the demon who ‘swallows,’ ‘devours,’ or
‘seizes’ ({@√2gṛ, √gras@}--cf. <ls n="lan,23,1">23<sup>1</sup></ls>N., {@√grah@}) the
sun or moon, and so causes eclipses. The
Sun is in terror, and implores Atri for help:
and the latter rescues the orb by prayer and
praise.</p>
<p>--Atri's mythical exploit is often men-
tioned in the Brāhmaṇas (see texts in Lud-
[Page369-b+ 49]
wig, v. 508; and cf. SBE. xxvi. 346). Thus
the PB., at vi. 6. 8, 11, narrates how, at the
request of the gods, Atri restored to bright-
ness the sun, which the demon had smitten
with darkness. On this account, it continues,
a present of gold, the symbol of brightness,
is made to a descendant of Atri at a sacrifice
now-a-days.</p>
<p>--Interesting are the Greek ideas about
the <gr></gr> that bringeth to nought
men's strength and wisdom--see Pindar's
{%Fragments%} [74], Bergk<sup>4</sup> i. <ls n="wg,411">411f</ls> and notes.</p>

action off, i. e. baffling,’ or, as in vocab. --
‘The sun, hidden…, Atri found ({@avindat@})
by the fourth prayer.’</p>
<p>--Ludwig reasons thus: The other priests
had a regular liturgy of three prayers for
combating eclipses. On this occasion, these
proved ineffectual. Atri knew a fourth, and
that brought the sun out. Hence the totality
must have been very long. This matter is
discussed in full by Whitney, l. c., p. lxv (= xxi).
Bergaigne, l. c., p. 383 (= 14), says it is a
mere case of the use of a sacred number
plus one--cf. {%Rel. védique,%} ii. 128.</p>

<head>NOTES TO PAGE {@77.@}</head>
<p>SELECTION XLI. RV. vii. 55. Magic
spells to produce sleep.--Ascribed to Vas-
iṣṭha. The hymn consists of three parts
differing in metre and disconnected in con-
tents. For a general discussion of it, see
Colebrooke's {%Essays%} <sup>2</sup>i. 27, and Whitney's
note, ibid. p. 112; JAOS. iii. <ls n="wg,336">336f</ls>; and esp.
Aufrecht, ISt. iv. <ls n="wg,337">337f</ls>. Sāyaṇa reports the
native traditions about the hymn. Thus:</p>
<p>Vasiṣṭha came by night to the house of
Varuṇa--to sleep, say some; to steal grain,
say others. He was assailed by the watch-
dog, which bayed at him, and fain would
have bitten him; but he laid the hound
asleep with the stanza beginning,
When, silv'ry Sārameya, thou,
and the one following.--Later superstition
uses the hymn to quiet uncanny creatures
at night: see Rigvidhāna, ii. 26.</p>
<p>--FIRST PART. The hymn next preceding
this in the RV., vii. 54, is to Vāstoṣpati, the
Lar familiaris, and consists of three stanzas.
The first part of our hymn, vii. 55. 1, is a mere
addition to these three stanzas, and belongs
accordingly to vii. 54 rather than to vii. 55,
as appears from the fact that the four
stanzas are all recited together in the cere-
mony of moving into a new house. See
ŚGS. iii. 4, AGS. ii. 9. 9, and esp. PGS. iii. 4. 7
--all in SBE. xxix.; and cf. MS. i. 5. 13.</p>
<p>The joining of this stanza to hymn 55 is a
simple misdivision of which the NT. shows
many parallel instances. Thus Mark ix. 1
belongs to viii.; chap. ix. should begin with
the Transfiguration. A converse misdivision
is at AV. vi. 63-64 as compared with RV.
x. 191.</p>
<p>--SECOND PART. Stanzas 2-4 are part of
a scene at the entrance to Yama's kingdom
or the regions of the blessed. Yama's two
watch-dogs (cf. <ls n="lan,83,17">83<sup>17</sup></ls>N. and introd.) guard the
pathway and keep out the wicked. Here
one of them barks at some who would come
in; and these, in turn, protest that they
are godly men, and so have a right to
enter in peace. See Kaegi, N. 274; Zimmer,
p. 421.</p>
[Page370-b+ 50]
<p>--THIRD PART. Stanzas 5-8 are the in-
cantations by which the entire household is
put to sleep. According to Aufrecht, l. c.
(or Zimmer, p. 308), it is while a maid is
receiving the visit of her lover; but that
seems a little doubtful because we have
plurals {@nas@} and {@sáṃ hanmas@} and {@vayám,@}
lines 12, 13, 15, and not duals.</p>
<p>With stanzas 5, 6, 7, 8 correspond respec-
tively stanzas 6, 5, 1, 3 of AV. iv. 5, and the
variants are interesting. The third part has
nothing to do with the second; but the dia-
skeuasts have juxtaposed them because in
both a dog is put to sleep.</p>

<p>SELECTION XLII. RV. vii. 56. To the
Maruts or gods of the storm-winds.--Com-
pare selection xxxv. (<ls n="lan,73,4">73<sup>4</sup></ls>) and introduction.
The hymn consists of two parts, of which
the first, here given, ends with stanza 10.
Number 11 is only the fragment of a stanza.
The rest (12-25) is in an entirely different
metre.</p>
<p>--The metre of the ten stanzas is without
doubt a secondary one, being simply a form
of the {@triṣṭubh@} syncopated at the sixth place,
i. e. with the prevailingly light sixth syllable
left out (cf. JAOS. xi. p. lxiii = PAOS. May,
1881). Thus,
<gr></gr>.
Each of the parts into which the verse is
broken is a ‘syllable-pentad’ or {@akṣara-@}
{@paṅkti;@} and each is an independent {@pāda,@}
since verbs at the beginning of the even
pentads are accented, e. g., at vii. 34. 3<sup>b</sup>, 3<sup>d</sup>, 4<sup>b</sup>,
6<sup>b</sup>. A pentad-couplet is sometimes joined
with a simply broken but unsyncopated
{@triṣṭubh@} verse to form a half-stanza or
stanza (e. g. i. 67. 8<sup>cd</sup>; 70. 4<sup>cd</sup>, 10<sup>cd</sup>; x. 46. 1<sup>gh</sup>);
and this fact seems to suggest the derivative
character of the pentads.</p>
<p>--The {@gāyatrī@}-stanza has 3 verses of 8
syllables; and the strophe has 3 stanzas, a
multiple of the number of verses. The
pentad-stanza has 4 or 8 verses of 5 syl-
lables; and the hymn has 5, 10, or 20 stan-
zas, a multiple of the number of syllables.
The hymns RV. i. 65-70 have each 5 stanzas
of 8 pentasyllabic verses; while vii. 34A and
vii. 56A and ix. 109 probably consisted origi-
[Page371-b+ 49]
nally each of 10 or 20 stanzas of 4 penta-
syllabic verses. Compare Bollensen, ZDMG.

<p>--Here the storm-gods are pictured as
lusty eagles, each sportively striving with
the others for precedence, and spreading his
wings over them in turn, to put them down
and master them.</p>
<p>--Ludwig interprets, ‘They vie in over-
whelming each other with their blasts’
({@pávana@} has also the mg ‘wind’). This
view accords with the character of the play-
ful, boisterous, and roaring gods, but not
with the conception of them as eagles; and
it would seem to require the reading {@abhí@}
{@…vápantaḥ.@}</p>
<p>--Roth, and after him the vocab., suggests
that {@svapū́@} is a ‘besom (that raises the dust)’:
‘they bestrew each other (in sport) with

stanzas is possible. In respect of contents,
the first three stanzas and the last three
make very good strophes. Stanzas 1, 2,

<p>{@16-17.@} NAMUCI-MYTH. ‘With foam of
the waters, Namuci's head, O Indra, thou
didst cause to fly asunder, when thou wast
conquering all thy foes.’ It appears to me
likely that the natural phenomenon to which
this refers is a water-spout (‘Trombe’) on
an inland lake. This fear-inspiring thing
may well be personified as a demon. The
verb {@úd avartayas@} means ‘didst cause to
move out or fly asunder with a gyratory or
centrifugal motion.’ This accords well with
the facts of the not infrequent phenomenon
as seen by unscientific eyes. See Major
Sherwill on Bengal waterspouts, JASB. 1860,
xxix. <ls n="wg,366">366f</ls>, with good pictures, and Th. Reye,
{%Die Wirbelstürme%}<sup>2</sup>, p. 17f. The line MBh.
v. 10. 37 = 328 seems to favor my view. The
whole passage is a reminiscence of the
Namuci-myth.</p>
<p>The head of the column is twisted and
made to burst asunder and scatter itself
({@phénena,@} instr. of accompaniment, lit. ‘with
foam,’ i. e.) in abundant foamy masses. Then,
with the dispersion of the column, often
[Page375-b+ 49]
comes (Sherwill, 370; Reye, 32) a heavy
rain. All this is set forth as gracious Indra's
prowess. --U. f. {@ájayas spṛ́dhas,@} see <ls n="lan,74,12">74<sup>12</sup></ls>N.</p>
<p>Bergaigne's discussion, ii. 346-7, may be
compared and also RV. v. 30. 7, 8 and vi. 20. 6.</p>
<p>--The form of the myth as it appears in
the Brāhmaṇas originates in a misconception
of the case-relation of {@phénena@} (see above),
which they take as an instr. of means, i. e.
as the weapon by means of which Indra
slew Namuci. So Sāyaṇa: {@phenena vajrī-@}

two strophes: 16, 17, 18 may be safely grouped
together; and of the remaining four, I have
followed Grassmann in rejecting st. 21, on

over, the tense of {@īdhe@} is proper to a final

and Whitney, l. c., p. 58.</p>
<p>--Although {@maṇḍala@} x. on the whole is
late, it yet contains antique passages; and
among these the following seems to belong:
so Roth. The hymn contains 16 stanzas, of
which 13-16 are palpably later additions.
Only 7-12 are actually prescribed by Āśva-
lāyana for use in the funeral service; but 1
and 2, although not rubricated, are given
for their intrinsic interest.</p>
<p>--The passage as it stands consists of an
introductory summons to the assembled
mourners (1-2); and of an address to the
departed (7-8); then, after bidding the
mourners disperse (stanza 9), the spokesman
implores the favor of the kindly-disposed
hounds of Yama, for the departed (11) and
for the company (12).</p>
[Page377-b+ 49]
<p>--In stanza 10, on the other hand, these
hounds are conceived as ill-disposed crea-
tures standing guard to keep the departed
out of bliss--see p. 370; and possibly the
stanza which originally belonged with 9 has
been displaced by the one in our text. Or
is stanza 9 itself the intruder ? see Bezzen-
berger's {%Beiträge,%} viii. <ls n="wg,202">202.</ls></p>

with days, with waters, with nights:’ i. e.
where the delights of earth are found again,
the change of day and night, cooling waters,
etc. Note the especial mention of waters in
the enumeration of the joys of heaven at
RV. ix. 113. 7f, and in the description of the
‘Assembly-hall’ of Yama Vaivasvata, MBh.
ii. 8. 7 = 317. And observe how very frequent
are the allusions to the waters in the men-
tions of Paradise in the Koran, e. g. xlvii.

<p>SELECTION LI. RV. x. 16. Funeral-hymn,
used at the ceremony of cremation.--Rubri-
cated are only stanzas 1-9 and 14--see p.
402. The rubricated stanzas are translated
by Max Müller, ZDMG. ix. p. viiif, and the
whole hymn by Zimmer, p. 402. Most of
the stanzas are addressed to Agni; but 3, 6,
and 7, to the dead man. The hymn has two
parts, clearly sundered by the metre.</p>
<p>--In the first, Agni is to burn the corpse,
not rudely, but gently, just enough to “make
it done.” To this end, a sacrificial goat
(st. 4) is provided, and (st. 7) the corpse is
covered with a caul, in order that Agni may
spend his fury on these things and spare the
[Page379-a+ 50]
corpse from too severe a burning. The
original purpose of this custom may have
been different. The Greeks had the custom
--see Il. xxiii. <ls n="wg,165">165f</ls>, Od. xxiv. 65f.</p>
<p>Moreover, Agni is to carry up the departed
to the Fathers or Manes, who have their seat
in the ‘fore-heaven’ (AV. xviii. 2. 48, Whit-
ney, OLSt. i. 59). Perhaps st. 8-10 did not
belong originally to the first part.</p>
<p>--The second part consists of heterogene-
ous material, vagrant stanzas, having some
connection, verbal or logical, real or apparent,
with the words or ideas of the first.</p>
<p>--Every stanza of the hymn, save st. 11,
appears in the AV., and some elsewhere also,
and with interesting variants.</p>
<p>{@4-5. enam:@} the minds of all present are
so exclusively upon the departed, that the

<p>--For this stanza there is abundant and

microcosm. Each element in him comes
from some element in nature with which it
has most affinity and thereto it returns (cf.
Eurip. Suppl. <ls n="wg,532">532f</ls>). These affinities are
pointed out with much detail in ŚB. xiv.

“Tvaṣṭar's making a wedding for his daughter”--
At this news all the world here comes together.
Yama's mother, during her wedding,
The wife of mighty Vivasvant, vanished.
They hid away the immortal from mortals.
Making a like one, they gave her to Vivasvant.
And she bare the two Aśvins when that happened,
And left two pairs behind her--Saraṇyū.</p>
<p>--“A braw story, but unco short.” The
actual text is tantalizingly fragmentary. We
can hardly hope to recover the legend with
any satisfactory completeness. Yāska gives
it thus:</p>
<p>Tvaṣṭar's daughter, Saraṇyū, bare twins
(Yama and Yamī) to Vivasvant. She foisted
upon him another female of the same appear-
ance ({@sávarṇām@}), and, taking on the form
of a mare, fied forth. Vivasvant took on
the form of a horse, followed her, and
coupled with her. From that were born the
two Aśvins or ‘Horse-men.’ Of the {@sávarṇā@}
was born Manu.</p>
<p>That is--Vivasvant, the Sun, and Saraṇyā,
were the parents of Yama and Yamī (<ls n="lan,83,8">83<sup>8</sup></ls>,
<ls n="lan,92,14">92<sup>14</sup></ls>), the first human pair. But there was
a coexisting belief in Manu (see {@manu@} in
vocab., and cf. SBE. xxv. p. lvii) as the father
of mankind. Are not RV. x. 17. 1-2 the frag-
ment of a legend which attempted to recon-
cile the two beliefs by fabling a {@sávarṇā@}
who should give birth to Manu, so that,
according to either myth, the human race
are the Children of the Sun ?</p>
<p>--Yāska {%tells%} more than does the text; yet
we are not sure that he (to say nothing of
Śaunaka) {%knew%} anything more than is con-
tained in the two stanzas. We are therefore
not obliged to interpret the stanzas so as to

[Page382-b+ 50]
<p>--The hymn is remarkable for its intrinsic
interest and beauty. And it has acquired
great notoriety in connection with the dis-
cussions of Suttee ({@= satī@}) or Hindu widow-
burning. Properly, {@satī@} (see {@sant 4@}) means
a ‘virtuous wife.’ Improperly, but more
commonly, it has come to be used of the
rite of self-immolation which she practised.
See the admirable article {%Suttee%} in Col. H.
Yule's {%Anglo-Indian Glossary,%} with some forty
pertinent extracts.</p>
<p>--That Suttee is an ancient custom appears
from many references to it in classical au-
thors. See Cicero, {%Tusc. disp.%} v. 27. 78; Pro-
pertius, iv. 12. 15; Plutarch, {%Moralia,%} p. 499;
Nicholas of Damascus, fr. 143 = frag. hist.
graec., ed. Müller, iii. 463; Strabo, xv. 30, p.
699; 62, p. 714; and esp. the story in Diodo-
rus Siculus, xix. 33-34, according to which
the rite is authenticated for 316 B. C. These
passages are given in full by J. Grimm, in
his masterly essay, {%Ueber das Verbrennen der%}
{%Leichen, Abh. der Berliner Akad.,%} 1849, p. <ls n="wg,261">261f</ls>
{%= Kleinere Schriften,%} ii. <ls n="wg,298">298f</ls>. And Peter von
Bohlen, in {%Das alte Indien%} (1830), i. 293-302,
cites a great deal of interesting pertinent
literature.</p>
<p>--The custom was abolished by the British
during the administration of Lord William
Bentinck, in 1829. The story of the aboli-
tion is well told by H. H. Wilson, in his con-
tinuation of James Mill's {%History of British%}
{%India,%} vol. iii. (= ix.), 185-192. For descrip-
tions, statistics, etc., see Parliamentary Doc's
1821. xviii.; 1823. xvii.; 1824. xxiii.; 1825. xxiv.;

<p>--From Müller's {%Essay on Comparative%}
{%Mythology, Chips,%} ii. 34f, or {%Selected Essays,%}
vol. i. (ed. of 1881), p. <ls n="wg,333">333f</ls>, it would appear
that the seventh stanza of our hymn had
played a great rôle in Hindu history. At
any rate, this idea is current, and seems
traceable to the {%Essay.%} Here it is stated
that the stanza was purposely falsified by an
unscrupulous priesthood, and that a garbled
version of it, reading {@agnéḥ@} for {@ágre,@} was
[Page383-a+ 50]
directly responsible for the sacrifice of thou-
sands of innocent lives. That the author is
in error on these points is argued with great
detail by Fitzedward Hall, JRAS. NS. iii. 183-
192. He shows that the misreading can be
traced to Raghunandana, ca. 1500 A. D., and
no further; and that Suttee was deemed to be
amply justified by warrants other than those
of the Vedic {@saṃhitā,@} which was by no
means the ultimate appeal for the mediæval
Hindu.</p>
<p>--In the literary discussions of Suttee, on
the other hand, the stanza has indeed played
a rôle. There is probably no other stanza
in the Veda about which so much has been
written. It was first cited, in mangled form
and as sanction for Suttee, by Colebrooke,
in 1794, {%On the duties of a faithful Hindu%}
{%widow, Asiatick Researches,%} 1795, iv. 209-219
{%= Essays,%} i. 133-140. It was discussed by
Wilson, in 1854, in his paper {%On the supposed%}
{%Vaidik authority%} for Suttee, JRAS. xvi. 201-
14 {%= Works,%} ii. 270-92. In answer to this,
Rājā Rādhākānta Deva, in 1858, endeavored
to adduce good Vedic authority for the rite,
JRAS. xvii. 209-17 (reprinted in Wilson's
{%Works,%} ii. 293-305). The most exhaustive
treatment of the various readings of the
stanza is that by Hall, l. c. Finally must
be mentioned the paper read by Rājendralāla
Mitra in 1870, {%On the funeral ceremonies%} etc.,
JASB. xxxix. 1. 241-264 (reprinted in his In-
troduction to the TA., p. 33-58, and with
additions in his {%Indo-Aryans,%} ii. 114-155); see
esp. p. <ls n="wg,257">257f</ls> (= 50f = <ls n="wg,147">147f</ls>).</p>
<p>--The Rigveda gives no warrant for the
custom. Śaunaka, in the Bṛhad-devatā,
furnishes important positive evidence against
it (see {%Chips,%} ii. 37); and likewise Manu, v.
156-8 (= <ls n="lan,64,10">64<sup>10</sup></ls>f, see N.). Cf. Kaegi, N. 51.</p>
<p>--The hymn was originally used at a
burial which was not preceded by cremation.
The situation and action are as follows. The
corpse lies on a raised place; and by it is
the widow.</p>
<p>STANZAS 1-2. The spokesman adjures
Death to remove, and to harm not the
living (1); and pronounces for them absolu-
tion from impurity (2).</p>
<p>STANZAS 3-4. The conductor of the cere-
[Page383-b+ 50]
mony dwells with joy on the fact that,
thanks to the efficacy of their prayers, they
have not joined the company of the dead (3).
Now, for the better safety of the survivors,
and wishing them long life, he sets a stone
near the grave as a symbolic boundary of
the domain of Death, as a barrier, so that
he may not pass to the space beyond or
domain of the living.</p>
<p>STANZAS 5-6. The wish and prayer for
long life is here continued.</p>
<p>STANZAS 7-8. The women are now sum-
moned to make their appearance together,
and, provided with ointments, ‘to go up to
the place,’ i. e. of course, where the dead
man and the widow are (7).</p>
<p>Here we must infer that they adorn the
widow (as a sign that she is to re-enter the
world of life), and that the dead man's
brother ({@devṛ́,@} ‘levir’) then takes her hand
in token of the levirate marriage.</p>
<p>The priest then bids her leave her lifeless
spouse, and makes solemn declaration of the
new relation into which she has entered (8).</p>
<p>STANZA 9. The bow is now taken from
the dead man's hand, in order that the power
and glory of which the weapon was the
symbol may remain with the survivors; and
a closing benediction is said for them and
for the departed.</p>
<p>STANZAS 10-13. “And now, with gentle
action and tender words, the body is com-
mitted to the earth.”</p>

the living. See AV. v. 19. 12 (explained by

ment of the mg. ‘May they hide Death by

<p>--There is much evidence that the age of
a hundred years was deemed entirely normal.
This appears from RV. i. 89. 9. Again, to a
question about a funeral lustration, Pāras-
kara (PGS. iii. 10. 14, 15) prescribes the use of
a special answer “in case the departed was
not yet a hundred years old.” Weber, ISt.
xvii. 500. SBE. xxix. 356. The ‘tenth decade
of life’ has a name, {@daśamī@} (see BR.). In the
Jātaka (Fausböll, vol. ii. p. 16), the Bodhisat
says to his father, when the latter sneezes,
O Gagga, live a hundred years,
And twenty others added on.…
Live thou a hundred autumns yet.

[Page384-b+ 50]
<p>--Very interesting are the classical stories
of Hindu longevity. Sometimes, according
to Onesikritos, they capped a hundred with
thirty more--Strabo, xv. 34, p. 701. The Uttara
Kurus are said, MBh. vi. 7. 11 = 264, to live
1000 or 10,000 years, and to this fable is prob-
ably due the report of Megasthenes <gr></gr>

<p>--Note that years are counted, now by
winters, now by autumns, and now by rainy
seasons (see {@hima@} and {@varṣa@} in vocab.), and

spouse (who was) a hand-grasper (and is)

<p>--Hillebrandt, at ZDMG. xl. <ls n="wg,708">708f</ls>, shows
plainly that this stanza, RV. x. 18. 8, belonged
originally to the ritual of the human sacri-
fice. Weber describes the ceremony at
ZDMG. xviii. <ls n="wg,269">269f</ls> = {%Indische Streifen,%} i. 65f.
The king's first queen was obliged to lie
with the dead victim. The situation is evi-
dent from the connection in which RV. x.
18. 8 occurs at AV. xviii. 3. 1-4. She is bidden
to rise with our stanza, {@úd īrṣva nāri@}--see
Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta-sūtra, xvi. 13. 13.</p>
<p>In this light, the logical connection of
pādas {%a b%} with pādas {%c d%} becomes clear. She
is to forsake the corpse and “come hither”
to the king.
Rise up, woman, to the world of the living.
Fled is the soul of him with whom thou liest. Come hither.
Quitting the embrace of hateful Death, the
queen rises and approaches him who had
already once taken her hand in wedlock and
now stands waiting for her as a suitor once
more. Upon thus resuming her proper rela-
tion of wife again, she is greeted with the
words:
To him who grasped thy hand, thy suitor now,
As wife to husband art thou become related.</p>
<p>--As appears from AGS. iv. 2. 18 = <ls n="lan,102,7">102<sup>7</sup></ls>,
this stanza was at an early date appropriated
for the funeral-service, where--as an accom-
paniment of the levirate marriage--it fits
very well ({@didhiṣú@} means also ‘a second
husband’). Regarding leviration, see Kaegi,

<p>--The stanza is fully discussed, JAOS. xi.
p. cxci = PAOS. May, 1884. It is interesting
as illustrating the varieties of cumulative
evidence that may be brought to bear on
the criticism of the Veda. Thus: 1. The
stanza is at the end of the hymn and out of
connection. 2. It is in a different kind of
metre. 3. The metre is bad of its kind.
4. The form {@íṣvās@} is bad Vedic--for {@íṣos;@}

6. The stanza is ignored by Āśvalāyana;

<p>SELECTION LIV. RV. x. 33. 4-9. The
aged priest to the young prince.--The hymn
has nine stanzas. The first three have nothing
to do with the rest. The rest (4-9) forms
two {@tṛca's.@} This passage has more than
common freshness, and also directness of
connection with the life of Vedic time. The
situation would seem to be somewhat as
follows.</p>
<p>--The old priest stood well with the gods,
so that the efficacy of his intercession with
them was of unusually good repute. Accord-
ingly, the foes of king Kuruśravaṇa had
once tried to win the Rishi over to their side
and away from his master, Kuruśravaṇa;
but in vain. He had remained faithful to
the royal family in whose service he long
had been.</p>
<p>Now at last king Kuruśravaṇa has passed
away, leaving Upamaśravas as his son and
heir. And in presence of the young prince,
the priest tells with pride and pleasure of
the old times, and speaks with regret of the
loss of his departed patron.</p>
<p>--Ludwig, iii. 182, has called attention to
the genealogical series of the RV. These
cover oftenest, of course, only three genera-
[Page386-b+ 53]
tions, since memory, unaided by records,
does not easily go further back. But for
preserving that amount of genealogical tra-
dition there was frequent need (Weber, ISt.
x. 78-88, esp. 82): thus, at the offering to
the Manes, the priest has to address by name
the father, grandfather, and great-grand-
father of the sacrificer; see ŚB. ii. 4. <ls n="lan,2,16">2<sup>16</sup></ls> or
SBE. xii. 365 or OLSt. i. 60: similarly at
the {@pravara;@} cf. ISt. ix. 322-3 or x. 78-9 or
Müller, ASL. 386.</p>
<p>In the present instance, however, we have
a series of five at least. Trasadasyu is a
prince of the Pūru tribe, and of the {%line%} of
Purukutsa (he is not necessarily the latter's
son--RV. vii. 19. 3), and is often mentioned
for his generosity and for the special favors
shown him by the gods. The series is

<p>--The import of the very obscure (if not
hopelessly corrupt) stanza is possibly this.
The first half tells what happens at the
burial of a wife. While the rest lament
aloud, the men show their sorrow for the
bereaved husband by pensive silence. The
second half contains reflections on the joys
[Page387-b+ 49]
of wedlock, whose appositeness is clear, if
we assume that they are uttered in the tone
of mournful regret. [But cf. ISt. v. 200.]</p>

<p>--STANZA 8. The situation is perhaps
this. A band of men, hotly pursued by their
enemies, are in the middle of a stream, which
they hope soon to have put betwixt them-
selves and the foe. They call out to each
[Page389-a+ 59]
other encouragingly the words of the stanza.
The famous hymn RV. iii. 33 involves a situ-
ation which is similar (Muir, i<sup>2</sup>. 338), and,
indeed, familiar elsewhere (Hebrews xi. 29;
Hdt. viii. 138).
The stream is stony. Hold ye well together.
Your footing keep. On ! make your crossing, comrades !
There let us leave them in a mood unhappy,
While we go out and on to happy conquests.</p>
<p>SELECTION LVIII. RV. x. 85. 36, 24-26,
32-33, 27, 43-47. The wedding-hymn.--The
stanzas are here given in the order in which
they are rubricated at 98^19^f--see p. 398.
Their uses in the ritual are discussed by
Haas in his treatise on the ancient wedding
customs of India, ISt. v. 267-412.</p>
<p>--The hymn is called the {@sūryā-sūkta@} or
“The marriage of Soma and Sūryā,” and
has received at the hands of Dr. J. Ehni,
ZDMG. xxxiii. 166-176, a mythological inter-
pretation, briefly summarized in AJP. i. 211.
The hymn has 47 stanzas, with an appendix
given by Aufrecht, {%Rigveda^2^%} ii. 682, and com-
prises somewhat heterogeneous matter (ISt.
v. 269). Most of the hymn occurs in AV.
xiv. 1 and 2, with many variants. Partial

token of wedlock.</p>
<p>STANZAS 24-26 and 32-33. Said just be-
fore the bride's departure for her new home.
Stanzas 24 and 32 are said by a third person;
25, 26, and 33 {%may%} be put in the mouth of
the groom. St. 33 may, as the Sūtra says,
[Page389-b+ 50]
be spoken on the way, when people come
out of their dwellings to gaze.</p>
<p>STANZA 27. Pādas {%a, b,%} and {%c%} are said to
the bride, and {%d%} to the couple, on their
arrival.</p>
<p>STANZAS 43-47. The groom first prays
to Prajāpati on behalf of himself and his
bride (43 {%a b%}), and addresses the latter with
good wishes and solemn benedictions (43 {%c d,%}
44); prays to Indra that the bride may be
fruitful (45); bids her hold her own with her
new relatives (46); and, finally, beseeches
the gods, on behalf of himself and his wife,
that they two may dwell in unity (47).</p>
<p>{@5-6. gṛbhṇā́mi…hástam:@} this, the dex-

I loose thee from Varuṇa's bond,
With which kindly Savitar bound thee.--
At the altar, in the company of the good,
I put thee unharmed with thy husband.</p>
<p>--The first half-stanza is an allegorical,
and the second a literal address to the bride.
In the allegory, the bond of Varuṇa is night
(Hillebrandt). Savitar is the ‘Impeller,’ not
only of the rising, but also of the setting sun
(RV. i. 35. 3<sup>a</sup>). He brings rest (ii. 38. 3, 4) by
sending night, whose gentle bond he lays
(Muir, v. 235-7) upon his daughter, Sūryā,
‘The Sun,’ till she is released for her bridal
with Soma, ‘The Moon’ (masc.), a union
which is the prototype (cf. Haas, 328) of
human marriages.</p>
<p>From the more literal point of view,
the bond of {@Varuṇa,@} as the upholder of the
established order of things, is (not night--
[Page390-a+ 49]
still less sickness--but) the tie by which a
maid is bound to her father till a man come
to loose and take her.--See the discussions

AV. has interpolated RV. x. 60. 12, evidently
because it has to do with the laying on of
hands--see the following.</p>
<p>{@2-3.@} That the laying on of hands has
especial virtue is a wide-spread belief--cf.

To judge from the ritual, the subject of {@ápi@}

<p>SELECTION LXII. MS. ii. 13. 23. Hiraṇya-
garbha.--The god Ka or Who (see notes to
selection lxviii.).--The RV. version (x. 121)
of this famous hymn has been translated by
Max Müller, ASL. 569, and {%Chips,%} i. 29; by
Ludwig, no. 948; and by Muir, with com-
ments, iv<sup>2</sup>. 15-18.</p>
[Page392-a+ 50]
<p>--STRUCTURE of the hymn. The seven
stanzas here given (or perhaps only 2-6)
constitute the original stock of the hymn.
To this is added, in the MS.-version, an
eighth stanza, quite impertinent to the rest;
and in the RV.-version, three stanzas (8, 9,
10), whose character is determinable by
various and interesting criteria.</p>
<p>Pāda {%d%} of each stanza is a refrain, ‘Whom
as god shall we worship with oblation ? i. e.
Who is the god that we are to worship with
oblation ?’ The later Vedic texts under-
stand it, ‘We will worship the god Who or
Ka,’ making of the interrogative pronoun a
deity whom they identify with Prajāpati
(selection lxviii.). The other pādas of stan-
zas 2-6 are relative clauses with {@yás, yásya,@}
{@yéna, yásmin.@} These may refer</p>
<p>{@A.@} To {@devā́ya:@} ‘Who (interrog.) is the
god,--who (relative) became king, etc. etc.,
--that we are to worship ?’ Ludwig: ‘Ka,
the god,--who is become king, etc. etc.,--
we would wait upon with havis.’--Better,
perhaps,</p>
<p>{@B.@} To {@hiraṇyagarbhás,@} although stanza
1 (and 7 as well) looks as if it might have
been an afterthought. This leaves the con-
nection of the refrain with the rest of each
stanza very loose; but this is perhaps just
what it ought to be.</p>
<p>--The hymn corresponds to RV. x. 121.
The comparative study of the differeing ver-
sions of the same traditional material, as it
appears in different Vedic texts, is interest-
ing and instructive; and there is no better
opportunity for it than this (see Preface,
p. v, N. 2).</p>
<p>The hymn occurs also at TS. iv. 1. 8; in the
VS., with the stanzas scattered, at xiii. 4,
xxiii. 3, xxv. 13, xxv. 12, xxxii. 6, 7, xxvii. 25;
and at AV. iv. 2. The TS. version follows
that of the RV. most nearly. Disregarding
the order, the same is true of the VS. The
AV. version looks like an unsuccessful
attempt at writing down a half-remembered
piece.</p>

<ls n="lan,85,12">85<sup>12</sup></ls>f.</p>
<p>--The prose of the Brāhmaṇas is not difficult. In
reading it, the chief thing is some familiarity with
the style, i. e. ability to divide up the discourse aright
into the little clauses and choppy sentences with
which it proceeds. As a help to this it is important
to observe that the particle {%átha%} marks the beginning
of a new clause, and that the postpositive {%vai%} marks
the foregoing word as the first of its clause. Analo-
gous is the use of {%nāma%} to distinguish a proper name
from an identical appellative. Cf. Pliny, {%Epp.%} vi. 31,
evocatus in consilium ad centum cellas (hoc loco
nomen)….</p>
<p>As my colleague, Professor A. P. Peabody, has
observed in his translations of Cicero's {%Offices%} and
{%Tusculans,%} there are certain connectives and illatives
which are employed as mere catchwords for the eye.
In manuscripts (Greek, Latin, Sanskrit) written with
letters of one size, with no separation of words, and
with very few stops, these particles serve the pur-
pose effected now-a-days by capitals, by division or
spacing, and by punctuation. In spoken language it
is often wrong to render them otherwise than by
inflection or by stress of voice.</p>

<p>--Birth, reproduction, and death are the three
great facts of all organic life. It is therefore natural
that the customs connected with marriage and burial
should take so important a place in the traditions
of primitive peoples. It can hardly be doubted that
a considerable body of these customs have their root
in Indo-European antiquity. For we find, as between
the various members of this family, many and most
striking coincidences of usage. The systematic ex-
position and criticism of these coincidences form one
of the most interesting chapters of comparative phil-
ology. It is not feasible to point them out in detail

groom) in the first place one should con-
sider, according to the rule, “Who on the
mother's and on the father's side,--” as
aforesaid.’</p>
<p>The rule referred to is in Āśvalāyana's
Śrauta-sūtra, ix. 3. 20 (p. 714, {%Bibl. Ind.%}), and
continues thus,</p>
<p>“--for ten generations back, are endowed
with knowledge, austerity, and works of
merit.” See Weber's interesting discussion
of ancestor-tests, ISt. x. 84-8.</p>

<p>{@2-3.@} Pronounce: {@sā tvam asi; amo@}
{@aham.@} --These interesting formulae occur
at AV. xiv. 2. 71; ŚB. xiv. 9. <ls n="lan,4,19">4<sup>19</sup></ls>; PGS. i. 6. 3;
AB. viii. 27; ŚGS. i. 13. 4. For {@pāda@} {%d,%} the
first three have {@sāmāham asmi; ṛk tuam.@}</p>
<p>--The {@sāman@} is conceived as male (ŚB.
iv. 6. <ls n="lan,7,11">7<sup>11</sup></ls>), and as sprung from the {@ṛc@} (as it is),
or as husband of it (ŚB. viii. 1. <ls n="lan,3,5">3<sup>5</sup></ls>). But to
the Hindu mind this lugging in of {@sāma@} has
a charming mystic significance, inasmuch as
{@sā@} plus {@ama@} makes {@sāma@} (see AB. iii. 23;
and SBE. i. 13). --The conception of heaven
as male and of earth as female is common
--see Preller, {%Gr. Mythologie<sup>3</sup>,%} i. 37f.</p>
<p>--The Vedic formula has a general sig-
nificance not unlike that of the ancient
{%quando%} (or {%ubi%}) {%tu Gaius ego Gaia%} and the
German {%Wo ich Mann bin, da bist du Frau,%}
{%und wo du Frau bist, da bin ich Mann.%} For
the Latin formula, see Rossbach, p. 351;
ISt. v. 216; Fleckeisen, 1880, p. 457; and
esp. the discussion by Marquardt, i<sup>2</sup>. 49N. 2.
For the German, see ISt. v. 216. Another
use of the Vedic formula, ISt. x. 160.</p>
<p>{@4-5. ehi,@} used just like <gr></gr> or <gr></gr>; but
cf. the variants noted ISt. v. 332N. --If we

order (8 + 8 + 11 + 8); but cf. TS. iv. 2. <ls n="lan,5,1">5<sup>1</sup></ls>.</p>
<p>{@6.@} Force of repetition--‘With each lead-
ing-around’ (1260). --She mounts the stone
or puts her foot on it as a symbol of the

enemies.</p>
[Page400-a+ 50]
<p>{@9.@} U. f. {@vadhv-añjalau@} (134 end) {@upa-@}
{@stīrya@} (see {@√stṛ + upa@}). The loc. is adjunct
of {@ā-vapati@} as well as of the gerund.</p>
<p>{@9-11.@} The first pouring ({@upastaraṇa@}) of
{@ājya@} and the two strewings of parched grain
on the bride's hands, and the second sprin-
kling ({@pratyabhighāraṇa@}) of {@ājya,@} constitute
the four portions “cut off” or separated
from the {@havis@} or sacrificial food. The first
is done by the groom; the rest by the brother.
The descendants of Jamadagni used to “cut
off” five such portions (ISt. v. 366; x. 95)
and so had to strew grain three times.--
Oldenberg's note. {@--eṣas,@} refers back.</p>
<p>--‘(The groom) having poured the sacri-
ficial butter on the bride's hollowed-and-
joined-hands, her brother or brother's repre-
sentative strews parched grain (on her hands)
twice [Thrice (is the custom) of the Jamad-
agnians.], sprinkling again (sc. {@ājya@}) over
the {@havis@} (= what he has left of the grain in
the basket) and over the {@avatta@} (= what grain
he has strewn on her hands). This (as just
stated) is the cutting-off-usage.’</p>
<p>{@12-17. ayakṣata,@} <ls n="wg,882">882.</ls> {@--pra…muñcātu@}
(cf. <ls n="lan,89,9">89<sup>9</sup></ls>), impv., w. lengthening (ISt. v. 340N.):
so {@nudātu, svadātu.@} --These stanzas are
mere adaptations of blank forms, so to say.
For examples of the changes (called {@ūhās@})
which circumstances demand, see AB. ii. 6. 6;
cf. AGS. iii. 8. 7. The forms are filled out
(see {@nigama@} in BR.) with a deity-name,
which, as here, does not always fit the metre.</p>
<p>{@18.@} ‘With the above mantras (uttered
by the groom), she, not-parting (fem.) her
joined-hands, should offer (the grain in
them), as with a {@sruc.@}’ The nose of the
{@sruc@} is at the side. She is therefore to pour
out the grain so,--not over her finger-tips.</p>
<p>--For the case of families who do not
strew grain but twice, we must assume that
the bride, when making her second oblation,
does not offer all the grain in her joined-
hands, but leaves some for her third oblation.
Her fourth is from the basket.</p>
<p>{@18-19@} (§ 14). ‘Without (any) leading
around (on the part of the groom), (the
bride should offer grain) with the nose of
the basket towards herself in silence the
fourth time.’ The “silence” refers of course
[Page400-b+ 53]
to the groom. The bride does not say any-
thing at any time (cf. SBE. xxix. 37).</p>
<p>--As prescribed above, the rites are per-
formed in the order following:</p>
<head>I. II. First and second rounds:</head>
<p>{%a.%} leading around, § 6;</p>
<p>{%b.%} mounting stone, § 7;</p>
<p>{%c.%} strewing grain, § 8;</p>
<p>{%d.%} oblation w. mantra 1 or 2, § 13.</p>
<head>III. Third round:</head>
<p>{%a.%} leading around;</p>
<p>{%b.%} mounting stone;</p>
<p>{%c.%} sprinkling ājya, § 10;</p>
<p>{%d.%} oblation w. mantra 3, § 13.</p>
<head>IV. Fourth time:</head>
<p>{%a, b,%} and {%c%} fall out;</p>
<p>{%d.%} oblation in silence.</p>
<p>{@19-20.@} U. f. {@ā_upya ā_upya@} (127 end)
{@ha@} (see {@ha@}) {@eke@} etc. ‘Some lead her around
after each strewing (of) the grain. In this
way ({@tathā@}) the last two oblations do not
fall together.’ That is, some do the rites in
the order:
{%c.%} strewing or sprinkling;
{%d.%} oblation w. mantra;
{%a.%} leading around;
{%b.%} mounting stone.
In this way, the fourth oblation comes directly
after the third mounting of the stone.</p>
<p>{@20-21. asyai,@} <ls n="wg,365">365.</ls> 3. ‘Then he loosens
her two braids, if they are made; (i. e. if)

<p>{@4.@} See {@saptapada@} in vocab. Seven, as a
sacred number, became the symbol for
‘many’ or ‘all.’ Doubtless the word always
suggested both the literal and the trans-
ferred mgs. Orig., {@sakhā saptapado bhava,@}
[Page401-a+ 50]
‘Be a constant friend,’ was a mere general
formula, used on sealing a friendship, e. g.
between two men, who would take seven
steps together hand in hand by way of rati-
fying their bond. {@Sāptapadam maitram,@}
‘Friendship (if genuine) is constant,’ be-
came a common proverb.</p>
<p>--The application of the formula to the
wedding-ceremony is prob. only a secondary
and special use; although it came to be
exceedingly important. Here {@saptapadī@}
being taken with strict literalness, it became
necessary to lead up to it by six other
formulae--as in the text. The matter is
explained at length and illustrated, by Haas
and Weber, ISt. v. 320-22: cf. BR. s. v.
{@saptapada;@} and AV. v. 11. 10.</p>

that one whose life was near its close could
not see these stars (ISt. v. 325: {%Indische%}
{%Sprüche,%} 2d ed., no. 2815). {@--ṛṣīn:@} here, as
