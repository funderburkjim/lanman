20314 <head>THE STORY OF NALA AND DAMAYANTĪ.</head>
20315 <p>§ 1. The trend of Aryan migration in India has been from the extreme north-
20316 west to the south-east, across the region drained by the Indus and its affluents, and
20317 called the Panjāb or Land of the Five Rivers; and again south-east, down the valleys
20318 of the Jumna and Ganges. One prominent group of Aryan immigrant tribes was
20319 that of the Kosalas, Videhas, and Magadhas, who settled in the {%lower%} valley of the
20320 Ganges, {%east%} of its confluence with the Jumna, in the districts now named Oudh
20321 and Behar, the Palestine of Buddhism.</p>
20322 <p>§ 2. Another group of tribes had their home on the upper Indus, in the north-
20323 west of the Panjāb. Theirs was the religion and civilization of which the Vedas
20324 are the monument. Later we find them advancing south-eastward, and establishing
20325 themselves on the {%upper%} course of the Jumna and Ganges, in Madhya-deśa, The
20326 Mid-Land. Foremost among them are the tribes of the Bhāratas, the Kurus, and
20327 the Panchālas. Here arose the system of Brahmanism; here the simple nature-
20328 religion of the Vedas developed into a religion of priests and sacrifices; here the
20329 Bhāratas attained a kind of religious primacy and the lustre of a great name,
20330 although gradually merging their tribal individuality with that of kindred tribes;
20331 here were fought the battles of the Bhāratas; and here, to ever-ready listeners, in
20332 school or forest-hermitage, at a sacrifice or a burial, were told the tales of these
20333 battles and their heroes. These are the tales that form the nucleus of the Great-
20334 Bhārata-Story ({@mahā-bhārata_ākhyāna,@} or, more briefly), the Mahā-bhārata.</p>
20335 <p>§ 3. These tales were probably first circulated in prose, until some more clever
20336 teller put them into simple and easily-remembered metrical form. The date of
20337 these first simple epics we do not know. They may well have existed several
20338 centuries before our era; but neither their language nor the notices of the Greeks
20339 afford any satisfactorily direct evidence upon the subject. Around this nucleus
20340 have been grouped additions,--historical, mythological, and didactic,--until the
20341 Great-Bhārata, as we now have it, contains over one hundred thousand distichs, or
20342 about eight times as much as the Iliad and Odyssey together.</p>
20343 <p>§ 4. Only about one-fifth of the whole poem is occupied with the principal
20344 story. This, in the briefest possible summary, is as follows. The two brothers,
20345 Dhritarāshtra and Pāndu ({@dhṛta-rāṣṭra, pāṇḍu@}), were brought up in their royal
20346 home of Hastinā-pura, about sixty miles north-east of modern Delhi. Dhritarāshtra,
20347 the elder, was blind, and so Pāndu became king, and had a glorious reign. He had
20348 five sons, chief of whom were Yudhishthira, Bhīma, and Arjuna. They are called
20349 Pāndavas, and are the types of honor and heroism. Dhritarāshtra's hundred sons,
20350 Duryodhana and the rest, are usually called the Kuru princes, and are represented
20351 as in every way bad. After Pāndu's death, his sons are brought up with their
[Page298+ 46]
20352 cousins. The kingdom devolved on Dhritarāshtra, who in turn made his nephew
20353 Yudhishthira the heir apparent.</p>
20354 <p>§ 5. Yudhishthira's exploits aroused the ill-will of his cousins, and, to escape
20355 their plots, the Pāndu princes went away to the king of Panchāla, whose daughter,
20356 Draupadī, became their common wife. In view of this strong alliance with the
20357 Panchālas, Dhritarāshtra thought it best to conciliate the Pāndus. So he divided the
20358 kingdom, and gave Hastinā-pura to his sons, and to his nephews a district to the
20359 south-west, where they built Indra-prastha, the modern Delhi. Here the Pāndavas
20360 and their people lived happily under king Yudhishthira.</p>
20361 <p>§ 6. On one occasion Dhritarāshtra held a great assembly of princes at his
20362 capital. The Pāndavas were invited and came. Yudhishthira was challenged to
20363 play with Duryodhana, and accepted. The dice were thrown for Duryodhana by his
20364 uncle Śakuni. Yudhishthira loses everything--wealth, kingdom, brothers, wife. A
20365 compromise, however, is made, by which the Pāndavas give up their part of the
20366 kingdom for twelve years, and agree to remain incognito for a thirteenth. With
20367 Draupadī, they retire to the Kāmyaka forest, on the Saraswatī.</p>
20368 <p>§ 7. For twelve years the Pāndu princes dwell in the wood. Many legends are
20369 told to divert and console them in their exile; and these stories, with the description
20370 of the forest-life of the princes, combine to make up the third or ‘Forest-book,’ the
20371 {@vana-parvan,@} which is one of the longest in the whole poem.</p>
20372 <p>§ 8. The thirteenth year arrived and passed. “Then in the fourteenth the
20373 Pāndavas demanded back their possessions, but received them not. From this arose
20374 the conflict. They overthrew the ruling house, slew prince Duryodhana, and then,
20375 although losing most of their warriors, they got back again their kingdom.” MBh.
20376 i. 61. 51 = 2280. Thus ended the Bhārata, doubtless, in its oldest and simplest form.</p>
20377 <p>§ 9. The poem, as we now have it, spins out the story of the combat through
20378 several books and through thousands of distichs. At length Yudhishthira is crowned
20379 in Hastinā-pura, and Bhīshma, the leader of the Kurus, although mortally wounded,
20380 instructs him, for about twenty thousand distichs, on the duties of kings and on
20381 other topics, and then dies. In the seventeenth book, the Pāndus renounce the king-
20382 dom, and in the next, the last, they ascend to heaven with Draupadī.</p>
20383 <p>§ 10. The Nala-episode illustrates very well how loose is the connection of the
20384 episodes in general with the main thread of the Bhārata. The story of Nala is one
20385 of those inserted in the third book (above, § 7), and its setting is as follows. Ar-
20386 juna had gone to the heaven of Indra to get from him divine weapons. The other
20387 Pāndavas, remaining in the forest with Draupadī, lament their brother's absence and
20388 the loss of their kingdom. Meantime the fierce and stout-armed Bhīma addresses
20389 his brother Yudhishthira, and offers to go out and slay their deceitful cousins.
20390 Yudhishthira counsels Bhīma to wait till after the thirteenth year, and is trying to
20391 calm his impetuous brother, when suddenly there arrives a mighty sage, Brihadaśwa.
20392 The holy man is received with honor and with the customary guest's-dish of milk
20393 and honey. When he is seated, Yudhishthira sits by him, bewails his sad lot, and
20394 asks, “Hast thou ever seen or heard of a man more luckless than I am ? I believe
20395 there never was one more unhappy.” “On this point,” replies the sage, “I will tell
20396 thee a story of a king who was even more luckless than thou. King Nala was once
20397 cheated out of his kingdom by a false dice-player, and dwelt in the forest, and
[Page299+ 49]
20398 neither slaves, chariot, brother, nor friend was left him; but thou art surrounded by
20399 heroes, brothers, and friends, and oughtest not to grieve.” Thereupon Yudhishthira
20400 begs him to relate the story at length. Accordingly, to console the king, and to
20401 show him that there is hope of regaining his kingdom, just as Nala regained his,
20402 Brihadaśwa begins as in the extract given in the Reader (1^3^).</p>
20403 <p>§ 11. CHAPTER 1. Nala was a prince of Nishadha. Damayantī was the
20404 lovely daughter of Bhīma, the king of Vidarbha. By the miraculous interposition
20405 of swans, the prince and princess become mutually enamored.</p>
20406 <p>§ 12. CHAP. 2. Bhīma accordingly holds a swayamvara (‘self-choice’) for
20407 her. The neighboring kings are invited, and she is permitted to choose for herself
20408 her husband from them. The chief gods hear of it and determine to go also. On
20409 their way, they meet Nala, who is bound on the same errand.</p>
20410 <p>§ 13. CHAP. 3. The gods request Nala to sue for them. Reluctantly consent-
20411 ing, he enters the chamber of the princess and tells how the gods desire her hand.</p>
20412 <p>§ 14. CHAP. 4. Damayantī refuses to listen to the arguments in favor of the
20413 gods. She desires that the swayamvara be held in the usual form, and that the
20414 gods be present, and informs Nala that she intends to show openly her preference
20415 for him. All this Nala reports to the gods.</p>
20416 <p>§ 15. CHAP. 5. The gods and kings assemble. The four chief gods assume
20417 the appearance of Nala. Unable to distinguish the real Nala, the princess, dis-
20418 tressed, prays to the gods, and they, in answer, resume their proper forms and
20419 peculiar attributes (see 14^12^ N.). Thereupon she chooses Nala. The kings express
20420 their sorrow, and the gods their delight. The gods give Nala the magic power of
20421 having fire and water whenever he wishes, and a wonderful skill in cookery. The
20422 wedding-feast is celebrated. Nala returns to Nishadha with his bride. They live
20423 happily, and have a son and daughter.--Here the extract in the Reader ends.</p>
20424 <p>§ 16. CHAPTERS 6-26. These tell of Nala's misfortunes, and their final happy
20425 issue. He loses everything, even his kingdom, by gambling, and wanders, hungry
20426 and half naked, in the forest. He is transformed into a dwarf, and becomes chari-
20427 oteer of Rituparna, king of Oudh. Damayantī, at her father's in Kundina, is led by
20428 certain tidings to suspect that Nala is at Oudh. By way of stratagem, she holds out
20429 hopes of her hand to Rituparna, if he will drive from Oudh to Kundina, some five
20430 hundred miles, in a single day, knowing well that only Nala's skill in horsemanship
20431 (see 1^4^) is equal to this task. Rituparna gets Nala to drive him thither through the
20432 air. Nala receives as reward perfect skill in dicing. His wife recognizes him by his
20433 magical command of fire and water, and by his cooking. He resumes his true form,
20434 plays again, and wins back all he had lost, and lives happy ever after.*</p>
20435 <p>§ 17. When Brihadaśwa had finished the story of Nala, Yudhishthira, pleased,
20436 asked him for perfect skill in dicing; and the hermit, granting him his prayer, departed.</p>
20437 <p>§ 18. This story is unquestionably one of the oldest and most beautiful
20438 episodes of the Mahā-bhārata. It was extremely popular in India; and to this is
20439 due the fact that it escaped the bad influence of Vishnuism, whose adherents have
20440 worked over the vast epic, changing and interpolating, and always for the worse.</p>
20441 <note n="299-*"><p>The student may read the entire story in any
20442 of the numerous translations--by Milman, Bopp,
20443 Rückert, and others. The most easily obtained is
20444 the very spirited English rendering of Edwin Arnold,
20445 in his {%Indian Idylls,%} Boston, Roberts Brothers, 1883,
20446 $1.00.</p></note>
[Page300-a+ 46]
20447 <p>§ 19. Even the Nala, especially in the first chapter, has suffered much from
20448 later hands; but on the whole it is one of the least corrupted episodes. Its antiq-
20449 uity is shown by the simplicity of manners implied in its incidents--the prince, for
20450 example, cooks his own food,--by the character of Indra (cf. 14^22^N.), and in other
20451 ways. See Holtzmann's {%Indische Sagen,%} Stuttgart, 1854, p. xiv. Bruce has
20452 attempted to reject definite passages throughout the poem, and has published, at
20453 St. Petersburg in 1862, a text of the Nala, reduced from 983 to 522 distichs.</p>
20454 <p>§ 20. The story begins at iii. 53. 1 (folio 58b) of the Bombay edition of 1877,
20455 and at iii. 2072 of the Calcutta edition of 1834.</p>
20456 <p>§ 21. THE METRE. The stanza ({@śloka@}) or distich consists of four octosyllabic
20457 verses ({@pāda@}). The first and second pādas form together a half-śloka or a line,
20458 divided at the middle by the caesura: likewise the third and fourth. The more
20459 important rules follow.</p>
20460 <p>{%a.%} Odd pādas end usually with a first epitrite, <gr></gr>, or antispast, <gr></gr>.</p>
20461 <p>{%b.%} Even pādas end in a diiambus, <gr></gr>, or second paeon, <gr></gr>.
20462 So the type of the half-śloka is <gr></gr>. But</p>
20463 <p>{%c.%} In no pāda may the syllables 2, 3, 4 form a tribrach, <gr></gr>, or anapaest, <gr></gr>;</p>
20464 <p>{%d.%} Nor, in the even pādas, an amphimacer, <gr></gr>.</p>

20597 <p>--It is not known where Nishadha was.
20598 Vidarbha, the modern Berar, is at the head-
20599 waters of the Taptī, between Nagpore and
20600 the Nizam's Kingdom, and about five hun-
20601 dred miles from Oudh. The general run
20602 of the story makes it highly probable that
20603 Nishadha was between Berar and Oudh.
20604 From chapter ix., it would seem to have been
20605 north of Oujein ({@ujjayinī@}). From an allusion
20606 in the Śatapatha-brāhmana, ii. 3. 2, Weber
20607 thinks it is in the south (i. e. from Madhya-
20608 deśa). These premises give some ground
20609 for the inference that Nishadha was in the
20610 valley of the Sind, which traverses Gwalior
20611 State, Central India. On the Sind is Nar-

21455 <head>SELECTIONS II.-XXI.</head>
21456 <head>FROM THE HITOPADEŚA, THE ‘BOOK OF GOOD COUNSEL.’</head>
21457 <p>§ 22. The first book ever printed in Sanskrit was Kālidāsa's ‘Seasons’ ({@ṛtu-@}
21458 {@saṃhāra@}), edited by Sir Wm. Jones, and printed in Bengalī letters in 1792. The
21459 first Sanskrit book ever printed in Nāgarī letters was the Hitopadeśa. It was edited
21460 by Carey, and printed at Serampore in 1803. The publication was undertaken, said
21461 Henry T. Colebrooke, “to promote and facilitate the study of the ancient and
21462 learned language of India in the College of Fort William.” It was chosen as the
21463 first for this purpose because of its easy style and intrinsic interest and because two
21464 English translations of it existed, one by Wilkins (Bath, 1787), and the other by
21465 Jones (London, 1799). To pedagogical reasons, accordingly, may be assigned in
21466 great part, the importance of this work: it has become important in the West,
[Page311+ 49]
21467 because the text is so well suited for tyros in Sanskrit; and in the Orient, because
21468 of the intrinsic value of its contents.</p>
21469 <p>§ 23. The book belongs to the ethico-didactic class of literature, and is what
21470 the Hindus call a {@nīti-śāstra@} or ‘cónduct-work.’ The term {@nīti@} (see this in the
21471 vocabulary) came to have special reference to the conduct of kings in their domestic
21472 life and in their foreign relations; a {@nīti-śāstra@} is, accordingly, a ‘Prince's hand-
21473 book of political and social ethics,’ a kind of ‘Mirrour for Magistrates.’ The Hito-
21474 padeśa consists of mingled verse and prose. The verses are mostly proverbs and
21475 maxims--often of the choicest practical wisdom; and their validity is proved,
21476 illustrated, and enforced by the fables, which are in prose.</p>
21477 <p>§ 24. The frame in which the work is set is simple and meagre. The sons of
21478 King Sudarśana of Pāṭaliputra^1^ (Patnā) are ignorant and vicious. He therefore con-
21479 vokes the wise men and asks if any one is able to reform the princes. Viṣṇuśarman
21480 offers to do so, and accordingly takes them in charge, and relates to them the stories
21481 which make up the body of the collection.</p>
21482 <p>§ 25. The Hitopadeśa is not an original work, but, rather, an excellent com-
21483 pilation of ancient material. The time of its composition has not been even
21484 approximately determined. The palm-leaf MS. brought by Mr. Cecil Bendall from
21485 Nepāl was written in the year 493 of the Nepāl era or A. D. 1373. And Professor
21486 Peterson's^2^ old paper MS. from Jeypore is of about the same age. At present we
21487 can hardly say more than that the work is at least 500 years old. In the working
21488 over of the material, the metrical portions would naturally be changed less, on the
21489 whole, than the prose; and in fact, many of the proverbs can be traced back in their
21490 identical form to works of antiquity. And travellers report that just such proverbs
21491 are current to-day in the talk of the lower classes of India.</p>
21492 <p>The author or editor of this collection of fables, according to the colophon^3^ of
21493 the Jeypore MS., was named Nārāyaṇa, and his patron and publisher was the prince
21494 Dhavalacandra.</p>
21495 <p>§ 26. The sources of this compilation are expressly said (end of the preface,
21496 17^8^) to be “the Pañcatantra and another work.” The first part of this statement
21497 is borne out by the fact that, out of forty-three fables in the Hitopadeśa, twenty-five
21498 are found also in the Pañcatantra. The latter work, as its name implies, consists
21499 of five books; while the Hitopadeśa is divided into four, whose titles are given in
21500 the preface, 17^7^. The correspondence is as follows. The first book of the Pañca-
21501 tantra answers in its frame-work to the second of the Hitopadeśa and the second of
21502 the Pañcatantra to the first of the Hitopadeśa. Five stories from the third book
21503 of the Pañcatantra, along with seven from the first, are scattered through the last
21504 two books of the Hitopadeśa. From the fourth book of the Pañcatantra only one
21505 story, “The ass in the tiger-skin,” appears in the Hitopadeśa; and from the fifth
21506 book, only three. It thus appears that, in the main, only the first three books of
21507 the Pañcatantra were drawn upon by the author of the Hitopadeśa; and Somadeva,
21508 in his Kathā-sarit-sāgara (chapters 60-64, much of whose substance is from the
21509 Pañcatantra, i.-iii.), has followed a similar course.</p>
21510 <p>§ 27. What the “other work” is we can hardly say with entire certainty. In
21511 it ought to be found together--if the statement of the preface is accurate--at least
21512 <note n="311-1"><p>From this point the spelling of proper names
21513 will no longer be anglicized.</p></note>
21514 <note n="311-2"><p>See Preface to his Hitopadeśa, p. i, ii, v.</p></note>
21515 <note n="311-3"><p>Peterson's ed., p. 161: cf. p. iv, v.</p></note>
[Page312+ 57]
21516 the eighteen fables of the Hitopadeśa which do not occur in the Pañcatantra.
21517 Had the preface said “other works,” the problem would be easier. Thus the story
21518 of the two giants, iv. 9, may be traced to the Mahā-bhārata, and the prototypes of
21519 other single stories are doubtless to be found in one and another ancient collection.
21520 Professor Peterson^1^ thinks that the “other work” is the Nītisāra of Kāmandaka.
21521 The identification deserves further study.</p>
21522 <p>§ 28. The contents of the Pañcatantra have been made the subject of one of
21523 the most important contributions to the literary history of the world by the late
21524 Professor Benfey. His principal results were published in his {%Pantschatantra%} (1859,
21525 see above, p. xviii, no 8), and in his introduction to Bickell's edition of the {%Kalilag%}
21526 {%und Damnag%} (1876). The latter contains, pages VI-X, a brief résumé of these
21527 results. The summary given by Keith-Falconer (1885, see p. 315) is a systematic
21528 and lucid account of the history of the fables, and is the one most to be commended
21529 to English-speaking students. Some of the most important items follow.</p>
21530 <p>{@A.@} The Indian original. In the sixth century of our era, there existed in
21531 India a Buddhist Sanskrit work, in thirteen chapters, treating of the conduct of
21532 princes.^2^ Its doctrines were inculcated in the form of beast-fables, or stories in
21533 which animals play the part of human beings.</p>
21534 <p>{@B.@} This Indian original was translated by a Persian physician named Barzōī,
21535 into the Pehlevī, the literary language of Persia, by command of the Sassanian king,
21536 Khosru Anūshīrvān, called The Just (531-579 A. D.).</p>
21537 <p>§ 29. {@c1.@} Both the Indian original and its Pehlevī version are irrecoverably
21538 lost; but from the latter were made two very notable translations. The first was
21539 into Syriac, made about 570 A. D., and called {%Kalilag and Damnag%} after the two
21540 jackals, Karaṭaka and Damanaka, who figured prominently in the introduction of
21541 the Sanskrit original. A single notice of this version had been preserved in a
21542 catalogue of Syriac writings made by Ebed-jesus (died 1318), and published by
21543 Assemani at Rome in 1725. A Chaldean bishop, Georgius Ebed-jesus Khayyāth,
21544 on his way to the ecumenical council in 1870, stumbled upon a manuscript of this
21545 Syriac version in the episcopal library at Mardīn. Through the mediation of Ignazio
21546 Guidi in Rome, and by a wonderful combination of lucky accidents and persistent
21547 efforts, the existence of “the lost manuscript” was made known to the eager in-
21548 quirers in Europe,^3^ and at last published in text and German translation by Bickell.</p>
21549 <p>§ 30. {@c2.@} The second translation from the Pehlevī was the {%Kalilah and Dim-%}
21550 {%nah%} or {%Fables of Pilpay%} in Arabic, made by Abd-allah ibn al-Moqaffa, a Persian
21551 convert to Islam, who lived under the caliph al-Mansor and died about 760. This
21552 version was published, though not in the best recension, by Silvestre de Sacy at
21553 Paris in 1816, and an English translation of it was given by the Rev. Wyndham
21554 Knatchbull, Oxford, 1819.</p>
21555 <p>According to the Arabic introduction, Dabshelim ({@deva-śarman@}) was the first
21556 king of the Indian Restoration after the fall of the governor appointed by Alexander
21557 <note n="312-1"><p>See his Introduction, p. 29, 43, Notes, p. 3. The
21558 Nītisāra was edited by Rājendralāla Mitra, in the
21559 Bibliotheca Indica, vol. iv.</p></note>
21560 <note n="312-2"><p>Such was Benfey's conclusion. It was ques-
21561 tioned by Weber, {%Indische Streifen,%} iii. 437. Bar-
21562 zōī's Pehlevī version (B.) may have been based on
21563 several {%different%} works--among them a Pañcatantra.
21564 Indeed, from the second chapter of the Arabic Kalilah
21565 and Dimnah, ‘The mission of Barzōī’ (Knatchbull,
21566 pages 40-41; cf. Keith-Falconer, p. xxi), and from
21567 other evidence (Keith-Falconer, p. liv f), this is the
21568 much more probable view.</p></note>
21569 <note n="312-3"><p>The story of the discovery is told by Benfey,
21570 in Bickell's book, pages XII-XXIII, as also in vari-
21571 ous periodicals there cited, p. XXII note, e. g. {%Lon-%}
21572 {%don Academy%} for Aug. 1, 1871.</p></note>
[Page313+ 49]
21573 at the close of his campaign in the Panjāb, B. C. 326. When firmly established,
21574 Dabshelim gave himself over to every wickedness. To reclaim the king, a Brahman
21575 philosopher takes up his parable, as did Nathan before David, and at last wins him
21576 back to virtue. The wise man is called in Arabic {%bid-bah%}^1^ and in Syriac {%bid-vag.%}
21577 These words are satisfactorily traced by Benfey, through the Pehlevī, to the Sanskrit
21578 {@vidyā-pati,@} ‘master of sciences.’ Accordingly, {%bidbah,%} which has become Bidpai or
21579 Pilpay in our modern books, is not really a proper name, but an appellative, applied
21580 to a ‘Chief Pandit’ or ‘Court-scholar’ of an Indian prince.</p>
21581 <p>The Arabic version is of prime importance, since from it have flowed other
21582 versions, which have been of the utmost influence in shaping the literature of the
21583 Middle Ages.</p>
21584 <p>§ 31. {@D.@} These versions are: {@1.@} The Later Syriac, made in the tenth or
21585 eleventh century, edited by Wright, and translated by Keith-Falconer; {@2.@} the
21586 Greek one, made about 1080, by Symeon Seth, a Jewish physician; {@3.@} the Persian,
21587 made some fifty years later, by Nasr Allah of Ghaznī; {@4.@} the Hebrew, ascribed to
21588 Rabbi Joel, and probably made before 1250, and published, with French translation,
21589 at Paris in 1881, by Joseph Derenbourg; {@5.@} the old Spanish, made from the Arabic
21590 in 1251, and published at Madrid in 1860 by Gayangos.</p>
21591 <p>§ 32. {@E.@} Of the descendants in the fifth degree from the original, only two
21592 need be mentioned: {@3.@} The Persian {%Anwār-i Suhailī%} or ‘Lights of Canopus,’ a sim-
21593 plified recast of Nasr Allah's, made about 1494 by Husain Waiz al-Kāshifī. English
21594 translations of this have been published by Eastwick and by Wollaston, see below.
21595 {@4.@} The {%Directorium humanae vitae,%} made from the Hebrew about 1270 by John
21596 of Capua, and printed about 1480.</p>
21597 <p>§ 33. {@F.@} From John of Capua's version flowed the famous ‘Book of examples
21598 of the ancient sages,’ {%Das bu°ch der byspel der alten wysen.%} It was made at the
21599 instance of Duke Eberhard im Bart, whose name and motto, EBERHART GRAF Z[u]
21600 WIRTENBERG ATTEMPTO, appear as an acrostic in the initials of the first sections.
21601 It was first printed about 1481, and has since been admirably edited by W. L.
21602 Holland, Stuttgart, 1860. Holland used, besides three manuscripts, two printed
21603 editions {%sine loco et anno,%} and enumerates 17 dated editions that appeared between
21604 1483 and 1592. Four dated editions appeared at Ulm between 1483 and 1485 ! The
21605 great number of editions of the work and their rapid succession are the best proof
21606 of its importance as a means of instruction and amusement in the fifteenth and
21607 sixteenth centuries.</p>
21608 <p>Another offshoot from the {%Directorium%} is the Italian version of A. F. Doni,
21609 entitled {%La moral filosophia,%} and printed at Venice^2^ in 1552. This is of special
21610 interest, because from it came ({@G@}) the English translation of Sir Thomas North,
21611 London, 1570.</p>
21612 <p>It may here be added that La Fontaine, in the second edition of his Fables
21613 (1678), which contains eleven books, says^3^ that he owed the largest part of his new
21614 material (books vii-xi) to Pilpay, the Indian sage. The edition of Henri Regnier
21615 (Paris, Hachette, 1883-85, 3 vols.) gives abundant references to the sources of each
21616 fable, and is especially to be commended to those who would compare the well-
21617 known French offshoots with the Indian originals.</p>

[Page314+ 52]
21622 <p>§ 34. From Benfey's investigations it appears that the truest extant repre-
21623 sentative of the Indian original is the Syriac version, {%Kalilag and Damnag.%} Next to
21624 the Syriac stands the {%Buch der Beispiele,%} which, besides, is in language remarkable
21625 for its dignity, strength, and beauty; upon this latter version, moreover, are based
21626 almost all the printed ones previous to 1644. To the German version almost exclu-
21627 sively, therefore, is Europe indebted for the wide-spread knowledge of this cycle of
21628 literature from the last part of the fifteenth to the middle of the seventeenth century.</p>
21629 <p>§ 35. After this account of the direct descendants of the Indian original in the
21630 Occident, it remains to speak of the history of that original in India, and of its
21631 sources. Whether Barzōī translated from one work of thirteen chapters (cf. § 28)
21632 or from several independent works, the fact remains that the originals of all of his
21633 sections may be certainly identified on Indian ground save three:^1^ five, namely,
21634 form the Pañcatantra; two other sections figure as a supplement to the first book
21635 of a later recension of the Pañcatantra; and yet other sections, three in number,
21636 appear in the Mahā-bhārata.</p>
21637 <p>The first three books of the Pañcatantra (above, § 26) were recast by Somadeva
21638 about 1070 A. D., in his Kathā-sarit-sāgara, chapters 60-64. Somadeva's abstract of
21639 these three books shows that they had the same form then as at the time of the
21640 Pehlevī translation (570). As representatives of the Indian original, the offshoots
21641 of the Pehlevī version surpass even the Indian offshoots. These latter, as respects
21642 their truthfulness in reflecting the Indian original, are arranged by Benfey as follows:
21643 first, the recension of the Indian original used by Somadeva; second, the one on
21644 which the Southern Pañcatantra (of Dubois) is based; third, the one from which
21645 the Hitopadeśa is made; and last, the one from which proceed the common Sanskrit
21646 recensions of the Pañcatantra.</p>
21647 <p>§ 36. At the time when Barzōī made his Pehlevī version, Buddhism was already
21648 on the decline in India, and Brahmanism regaining its lost supremacy. It was not
21649 to be expected on the one hand that the Brahmans would allow a work of such great
21650 artistic merit as the original {%Mirrour for Magistrates%} to be lost and forgotten, nor,
21651 on the other, that they would preserve it without transforming its whole spirit, which
21652 was that of fanatical hatred for Brahmanism. They have, therefore, omitted or
21653 transformed such parts as showed most Buddhist animus, leaving, however, many
21654 marks uneffaced which betray its Buddhist origin.</p>
21655 <p>In one other way, too, the original was modified. In most of its sections a
21656 doctrine was inculcated by means of a single fable or story, and only a sparing use
21657 was made of inserted apologues. But gradually the means became an end; into the
21658 main story were inserted others, and others still into these, until the main story
21659 became a mere frame, and the result was comparable to a set of Chinese boxes.^2^</p>
21660 <p>§ 37. Respecting the sources of the Indian original only a general statement
21661 can be made. There were current among the Buddhists, fables and parables which
21662 they ascribed to Buddha, and whose sanctity they sought to increase by identifying
21663 the best character in any story with Buddha himself in a former birth. Hence the
21664 tales were called {%Jātakas%} or ‘Birth-stories.’ There is evidence of the existence of a
21665 collection with that name as early as the Council of Vesālī, about 380 B. C.; and in
21666 <note n="314-1"><p>Of the remaining three, one is shown by its
21667 spirit of deadly hatred towards the Brahmans to be
21668 the work of Buddhists, and the other two are in
21669 Benfey's judgment genuinely Indian.</p></note>
21670 <note n="314-2"><p>Pedagogical reasons forbade the retention of
21671 this arrangement, except by way of specimen. Thus
21672 selection ix is boxed into viii, and xv and xvi into
21673 xiv.</p></note>
[Page315-a+ 54]
21674 the fifth century after Christ the Jātakas were put into the form in which they now
21675 appear in the Sutta-piṭaka. They are distinguished for quaint humor and gentle
21676 earnestness, and teach the duty of tender sympathy with animals and even of
21677 courtesy to them. With these stories may be identified many if not all of the
21678 fables of the Hitopadeśa.</p>
21679 <p>§ 38. The relation of the earliest Greek and Indian fables has been the subject
21680 of much discussion. Wagener tried to show that the Greeks derived their apologues
21681 from the Hindus; Weber, that the Hindus got many from the Greeks. Correspon-
21682 dences there undoubtedly are; but the difficulty is that the earliest forms of the
21683 fables--which would furnish the only safe basis for comparison--are irrecoverably
21684 lost. Aesop and his fables are mentioned by Plato and others as very well known:
21685 but whether he was a Phrygian, a Jew, or an Egyptian is matter of dispute; and
21686 even the <gr></gr> of Babrius (ca. 100 A. D.), which tradition offers us as the
21687 oldest extant collection, are removed some 700 years from the traditional date of
21688 Aesop. The collection on which the common modern fable-books are based was
21689 made by the Byzantine monk Maximus Planudes, ca. 1325.</p>
21690 <p>At all events, the oldest extant documentary collections of Greeks or of Bud-
21691 dhists are much later than Alexander's invasion; and considering the intercourse of
21692 the Greeks with India after that event, it is quite possible that the influence and
21693 borrowing were in both directions.</p>
21694 <p>§ 39. We have seen how, under the New Persian Dynasty, and afterwards
21695 under the Caliphs, with the spread of Islam, the Indian stories were carried over
21696 western Asia and all southern and western Europe. But this is not all. The pious
21697 pilgrims to India from China took home with them Buddhist apologues, which were
21698 translated into Chinese, and wandered then to Korea and Japan. They have since
21699 been translated from Chinese into French by Stanislas Julien ({%Les Avadânas,%} Paris,
21700 1859). Among the Mongols, too, Benfey has discovered many of these apologues;
21701 and through the Mongols during their supremacy these stories came to the Slavic
21702 peoples, and even to the Finns and Samoyeds.</p>

21752 <p>§ 41. THE LITERARY HISTORY of the Indian apologues has often been treated.
21753 So by Silvestre de Sacy, Loiselcur Deslongchamps, H. H. Wilson ({%Works,%} London,
21754 1864, iv. 1-159), Lancerean (in his Pantchatantra, Paris, 1871), Max Müller (On the
21755 migration of fables, {%Chips,%} London, 1875, iv. 145-209), Rhys Davids (Introduction
21756 to his translation of the Jātakas, London, 1880), J. Schoenberg (in the very readable
21757 introduction to his German translation of the Hitopadeśa, Vienna, 1884). Keith-
21758 Falconer's account is on the whole the best (§ 40).</p>
21759 <p>The French translation of the Hitopadeśa by É. Lancereau (Paris, Maisonneuve,
21760 1882) is especially useful on account of the full and convenient references to the
21761 books where the analogues of the different fables may be found. This book is
21762 intended by the citation “Lancereau.”</p>
21763 <p>§ 42. EDITIONS AND TRANSLATIONS. The most accessible text edition is that
21764 of Professor Peter Peterson (Bombay, Government Central Book Depot, 1887. Price
21765 1 rupee 10 annas). It contains an introduction most helpful for reading the text
21766 in course. It forms no. xxxiii of the Bombay Sanskrit Series. The text edition
21767 used most often as a standard of reference is that of Schlegel and Lassen (Bonn,
21768 1829).</p>
21769 <p>A literal English version has been given by Fr. Pincott (London, W. H. Allen,
21770 1880). A cheap reprint of Wilkins's translation appeared in Henry Morley's Uni-
21771 versal Library (London and New York, Routledge, 1885).</p>
21772 <p>§ 43. METRES. Aside from the common śloka--see p. 300, § 21--there occur
21773 in this book several other metres requiring description. The following five are
21774 monoschematic--i. e. the stanza consists of one metrical scheme four times repeated.
21775 The first two are simple and natural iambic-choriambic rhythms and are common in
21776 the Veda. The name {@vasanta-tilakā@} means ‘Grace of the spring-time’; {@mālinī,@}
21777 ‘Garlanded’; {@rathoddhatā@} seems to mean ‘Car-proud.’
21778 {%a.%} <gr></gr> {@jagatī,@} 22^11^.
21779 {%b.%} <gr></gr> {@triṣṭubh,@} 26^1^.
21780 {%c.%} <gr></gr> {@vasanta-tilakā,@} 18^14^, 26^8^.
21781 {%d.%} <gr></gr> {@mālinī,@} 22^22^.
21782 {%e.%} <gr></gr> {@rathoddhatā,@} 56^11^.
21783 The triṣṭubh is simply a catalectic form of the {@jagatī;@} but the catalexis gives the new

21787 <p>§ 44. THE {@āryā@} METRE is based on the number of morae--not on Thus:
21788 the number of syllables. See Whitney, §§ 76-79. A light syllable counts <gr></gr>
21789 as one mora; a heavy syllable, as two. In general, the {@āryā@}-foot con- <gr></gr>
21790 sists of four morae. These appear either as two heavy syllables, or with <gr></gr>
21791 one heavy one at the beginning or at the middle or at the end, or as <gr></gr>
21792 four light syllables. In each half-stanza, a caesura occurs at the end of <gr></gr>
21793 the third foot, and the eighth or last foot of each half-stanza is catalectic.</p>
21794 <p>The sixth foot of the first half-stanza must be an amphibrach, <gr></gr>, and that
[Page317-a+ 44]
21795 of the second must be a single light syllable. No odd foot may be an amphibrach.
21796 The metre occurs at 26^3^ and 56^5^ to 56^10^. The scheme is:
21797 <gr></gr>
21798 <gr></gr>
21799 Applying this scheme, for example, to 56^5-6^, we have, with the proper resolutions:

[Page317-b+ 39]
21839 Buddhist books it is called Pāṭali-gāma,

21841 Pāṭali-putra is a mere corruption of Pāṭali-

22486 --It is told by Damanaka to Karaṭaka (see
22487 p. 312, § 29), and into it is inserted the story
22488 of the lion, the old hare, and the well (selec-
22489 tion ix., see 32^12^N.), told by the crow to the
22490 crow-hen.</p>
22491 <p>--Selection viii. answers to Pañcatantra,
22492 book i., fable 6, which is told in like manner
22493 by Damanaka. He makes the crow and
22494 crow-hen ask a jackal for advice, and the
22495 latter tells them the inserted story of the
22496 heron, the fishes, and the crab (= selection
22497 xviii.). Damanaka then finishes his story
22498 about the crows (= selection viii.), and fur-
22499 ther enforces its moral by the story of the
22500 lion (selection ix.). The {%motif%} of selection
22501 viii. is analogous to that of selection xvi.,

22533 <p>--Selection ix. answers to Pañcatantra,
22534 book i., fable 8. The Buddhist version, the
22535 Banyan Deer Jātaka, has deep moral sig-
22536 nificance as showing the beauty of self-
22537 sacrifice and the excellence of loving “all
22538 things, both great and small.” This Jātaka
22539 is mentioned by name and illustrated on the
22540 bas-reliefs of the tope or {%Stūpa of Bharhut,%}
22541 Cunningham, plate xxv, dating from 200
22542 B. C. or earlier. In the Sanskrit forms, the
22543 Jātaka has developed into a simple story
22544 that shows how the weak animals get the
22545 better of a powerful tyrant, not by force,
22546 but by cunning. Somadeva gives the story
22547 at lx. 91-107. Compare further</p>

23220 <head>EXTRACTS FROM THE KATHĀ-SARIT-SĀGARA.</head>
23221 <p>§ 45. The work from which the following extracts are taken holds a rather
23222 exceptional place in Hindu literary history, inasmuch as its date and authorship are
23223 quite definitely known. According to the author's fancy, it unites in itself all
23224 stories as does the ocean all rivers, and he therefore calls it the ‘Ocean of the
23225 Streams of Story’ or Kathā-sarit-sāgara. Following out the metaphor, he divides
23226 the work into one hundred and twenty-four chapters, called {@taraṅgas@} or ‘billows.’
23227 By another division, independent of the one just mentioned, the work is broken into
23228 eighteen books, called {@lambakas,@} which Brockhaus, without authority, conjectured
23229 to mean ‘surges.’ The work contains about 22,000 distichs, that is, about one-
[Page332-a+ 68]
23230 quarter as much as the Mahā-bhārata, and not quite twice as much as the Iliad and
23231 Odyssey together. An analysis of its contents is given by II. II. Wilson, {%Works,%}

23257 <p>§ 47. The concluding verses of the work were printed from new and trust worthy
23258 manuscript material by Bühler.^1^ From them it appears that the author was named
23259 Soma, i. e. Somadeva, and was the son of the virtuous Brahman Rāma. Somadeva
23260 says that he made this collection of stories to please the queen Sūryavatī, and gives
23261 some of the facts relating to the royal house of Kaśmīr then regnant. These facts
23262 are supplemented and confirmed by the Rājataraṅginī or ‘Chronicles of Kaśmīr,’
23263 written by Kalhaṇa, about 1148-1157 A. D.^2^ Combining these sources, Bühler
23264 reaches conclusions which may here be summarized briefly.</p>
23265 <p>§ 48. In the year 79, i. e. 4079, of {@loka-kāla,^3^@} Saṃgrāmarāja, a descendant of
23266 Sātavāhana (of Śāta-), succeeded to the throne of Kaśmīr. This was A. D. 1003. He
23267 was followed in 1028 by his son Ananta. Anantadeva is described as weak-minded,
23268 rash, and impetuous, but as brave even to fool-hardiness. He married Sūryavatī,
23269 daughter of the king of Jālandhar ({@jālaṃdhara@}). She brought him entirely under
23270 her power, and induced him, in 1063, to abdicate in favor of his son Kalaśadeva.
23271 He soon repented his hasty step and got control of the government again. Mean-
23272 time, Kalaśa abandoned himself to every vice, and, in rage, his parents determined
23273 to punish him, and give over the kingdom to his eldest son Harṣa. In fact, Ananta
23274 retired with his court to Vijayakṣetra, the modern Bījbahār, in [41]55 = A. D. 1079,
23275 and after two years of feud with Kalaśa, took his own life in 1081, leaving the power
23276 in the hands of Kalaśa, who held it till 1089, when he was succeeded by Harṣa.
23277 Sūryavatī burned herself on the funeral pile of her husband Ananta. Now since,
23278 according to Somadeva, Kalaśa was king when the work was finished, and since it
23279 was written for Sūryavatī, the date of the composition must fall between Ananta's
23280 first abdication and his wife's death, i. e. between 1063 and 1081 A. D.</p>
23281 <p>§ 49. The real source of the Kathā-sarit-sāgara is stated by Somadeva^4^ to be
23282 the Bṛhat-kathā or ‘Great Narration’ of Guṇāḍhya. This work, according to
23283 Bühler,^5^ goes back to the first or second century of the Christian era; but no manu-
23284 script of it has yet been published. On the other hand, important evidence of its
23285 general character and contents is afforded by the two works that have flowed from

23298 it, the Bṛhat-kathā-mañjarī and the Kathā-sarit-sāgara. Each is a recast of Guṇ-
23299 āḍhya's original. The former was made by Kṣemendra Vyāsa-dāsa, a contemporary
23300 of Somadeva. Its date is not far from the year 1037 A. D., and it is therefore some
23301 thirty or forty years prior to Somadeva's work.^1^ Both Kṣemendra and Somadeva
23302 distinctly assert that they translated from an original in the {@paiśācī bhāṣā@} or
23303 ‘Goblin dialect’; and internal evidence^2^ confirms their assertions, and, further,
23304 makes it certain that each worked independently of the other. But Somadeva seems
23305 to have been well aware of the faults of his predecessor, and his work is a decided
23306 improvement upon that of Kṣemendra, whose recast is only about one-third as long
23307 as Somadeva's, and sacrifices poetic merit in the effort to be brief.</p>
23308 <p>§ 50. Although Somadeva was a Brahman, there are yet many remaining traces
23309 of the Buddhist character of his original, and even direct allusions^3^ to the Buddhist
23310 Birth Stories occur. Indeed, Weber maintained^4^ that Guṇāḍhya was a Buddhist.
23311 The name {@paiśācī bhāṣā@} seems to have covered a number of Low Prākrit dialects^5^
23312 spoken by the most ignorant and degraded classes in many different parts of India.
23313 In one of these dialects the Bṛhat-kathā is actually written.</p>
23314 <p>§ 51. It remains--partly by way of introduction to selection xxvii.--to com-
23315 plete and summarize the half-mythical account there given of the origin of the stories.</p>
23316 <p>In a retired spot on the Himālayan peak Kailāsa, the god Śiva, to please his
23317 wife Pārvatī, was telling her (Kathā-sarit-sāgara, i. 48) the adventures of the Seven
23318 Fairy Kings. Unfortunately, he was overheard by his Gaṇa or attendant (see {@gaṇa@}),
23319 Puṣpadanta. Puṣpadanta foolishly told the tale to his wife, and she recited it in
23320 turn to Pārvatī. This made it appear that Śiva had palmed off upon her an old
23321 story. Even on learning the truth, she was still exceedingly enraged, and cursed
23322 Puṣpadanta to be born as a mortal. She also inflicted the same curse on the Gaṇa
23323 Mālyavant who interceded for him.</p>
23324 <p>At their entreaty, however, she set a limit ({@anta@}) to the curse of each, speaking
23325 (i. 59) to this effect: “There is a Yakṣa named Supratīka, who, cursed to become a
23326 mortal, is living in the Vindhya as a Piśāca, under the name of Kāṇabhūti. When
23327 thou, Puṣpadanta, shalt see him, and tell him the tale which thou overheardest Śiva
23328 telling me, then thou shalt be released from thy curse. When Kāṇabhūti shall have
23329 told it to thee, Mālyavant, he shall be released. And when thou, Mālyavant, shalt
23330 have published it to the world, thou shalt be free also.”</p>
23331 <p>§ 52. Puṣpadanta, accordingly, is born as Vararuci or Kātyāyana, meets Kāṇa-
23332 bhūti, narrates to him the seven stories of adventure in seven hundred thousand
23333 stanzas (ii. 26), and is released.</p>
23334 <p>Kāṇabhūti, meantime, remained in the Vindhya, waiting the coming of Mālya-
23335 vant. The latter is duly born as a Brahman (vi. 19, 20), with the name Guṇāḍhya,
23336 at Supratiṣṭhita (vi. 8) in Pratiṣṭhāna.^6^ This is identified with Paiṭhān on the
23337 Godāvarī (vi. 72), about 150 miles from Bombay, east by north. After travelling in
23338 the Deccan, Guṇāḍhya returns to the splendid royal city of Supratiṣṭhita (vi. 24) and
23339 is appointed a minister (vi. 70) of Sātavāhana, the king of whom the story in selec-

23354 tion xxvi. is related. In consequence of a wager with his colleague Śarvavarman
23355 (52^1^), Guṇāḍhya forswears the use of Sanskrit, Prākrit, and the local veruacular.
23356 Since he knows no other language, he is forced to keep silence, and so to give up his
23357 position as minister. With two pupils he retires to the Vindhya, and, falling in
23358 with a host of Piśācas (vii. 26), learns their dialect. In this he addresses Kāṇabhūti,
23359 who exists himself at the time as a Piśāca. Kāṇabhūti tells the tales in ‘his own
23360 dialect’ ({@svabhāṣayā,@} 53^4^), i. e. Paiśācī, to Guṇāḍhya. The hearer writes them down
23361 in Paiśācī, and with his own blood, since he had no ink by him. Kāṇabhūti is then
23362 released.</p>
23363 <p>Guṇāḍhya, in order to “publish the stories to the world,” sends the manuscript
23364 to Sātavāhana. The king, puffed up by his newly-acquired knowledge of Sanskrit
23365 grammar (52^28^), rejects the stories on account of their dialect. Guṇāḍhya, overcome
23366 with grief, reads aloud to his two pupils six hundred thousand distichs and casts the
23367 manuscript, leaf by leaf, into the fire, while the beasts stand about in a circle and
23368 listen with tears in their eyes.^1^ One hundred thousand couplets Guṇāḍhya keeps,
23369 because they especially pleased his pupils. At last the king hears of the strange
23370 proceeding, comes, and takes what is left,^1^ namely the Bṛhat-kathā. The pupils
23371 expounded the poem to the king and he composed the first book or {@lambaka,@} called
23372 Kathāpīṭha (56^10^N.), to serve as a general introduction to the rest, after Guṇāḍhya
23373 had ascended to heaven (56^4^), released.^2^</p>

23513 <p>--In the Cariyā-piṭaka, Pāli text, ed.
23514 Morris, p. 77, Śibi appears as an incarnation
23515 of the Future Buddha. Sakka, in the form
23516 of a blind old beggar, asks him for one of
23517 his eyes, and he gladly gives up both of
23518 them. This is represented in a mural paint-
23519 ing of a cave at Ajaṇṭā--J. Burgess, {%Cave%}
23520 {%Temples of India,%} p. 315. Beal gives a
23521 Chinese version of the story in his {%Buddhist%}
23522 {%Literature in China,%} p. 31-41. And the tale

23764 S. gives the lack of ink as a reason; K.

23766 a popular superstition like the Germanic
23767 one which ascribes peculiar virtues to pure
23768 spittle (cf. also St. Mark viii. 23) and to
23769 blood. Life rests in the blood, the “vital

23926 shillings 6 pence.</p>
23927 <p>Burnell's introduction contains an argument on
23928 the date of our Manu text. Professor Hopkins has
23929 summed up and criticised this argument (JAOS.
23930 xiii. p. xxviii = PAOS. May, 1885), and concludes
23931 that it brings us not one step nearer a solution of
23932 the problem.</p>
23933 <p>Bühler's introduction (p. civ-cxviii) gives a learned
23934 discussion of the date. Of this, Hopkins makes a
23935 résumé (JAOS. xiii. p. cxcviii = PAOS. May, 1887).
23936 He finds Bühler's conclusions probable, but does not
23937 think them absolutely proved by the proofs adduced.</p>
23938 <p>The text-edition of Loiseleur Deslongchamps
23939 (Paris, 1830) is hardly obtainable now. It is safe
[Page340-b+ 50]
23940 to say that Jolly's robs all preceding ones of their
23941 value, inasmuch as it is the result of far-reaching
23942 critical studies. The principal places in which Jolly's
23943 text varies from that of the Reader are 1. 97; ii. 11, 76,
23944 125; xii. 23, 37, 42, 45, 90, 95, 96.</p>
23945 <p>The general theory of the origin of the Laws of
23946 Manu was summed up and criticised by Whitney
23947 (JAOS. xiii. p. xxx = PAOS. May, 1885). Meantime,
23948 however, Bühler's Introduction has put the question
23949 in a new light.</p>
23950 <p>The relations of our text to the Mahā-bhārata are
23951 ably discussed by Hopkins, JAOS. xl. 239-275 (cf.
23952 PAOS. Oct., 1883). Here may be found, convenlently
23953 assembled, quotations from Manu in the Sūtras and
23954 inscriptions, the legendary material about him in the
23955 Epic, and a careful discussion of the passages in the
23956 Epic which profess to be the declarations of a per-
23957 sonal Manu.</p>
23958 <p>By way of calling attention to the interesting sub-
23959 ject of the knowledge of the Greeks concerning India,
23960 occasional citations are given. The references to
23961 Strabo's <gr></gr> (of which book xv., chap. 1,
23962 §§ 1-73 describe India) follow Casaubon's paging.</p>
23963 <p>The following introduction is in the main a brief
23964 abstract of some of the more important points of
23965 Bühler's introduction.</p>
23966 <p>§ 54. The native tradition respecting the origin of the Mānava-dharma-śāstra
23967 takes the book to be the work of an individual law-giver. In accordance with this
23968 tradition, until quite recently, it has been usual for English writers to call the
23969 treatise ‘The Laws of Manu.’ And this designation may still be used, provided
23970 only it be used with an intelligent mental reservation, which takes due account of
23971 the results of modern criticism. For in the light of critical study, the figure of
23972 Manu, as a historical person, fades away; but, on the other hand, we find that Manu
23973 as a name is one of the greatest and most reverend of the Hindu antiquity. Ques-
23974 tions thus arise: Whence the greatness of this name ? What was the real origin of
23975 this law-book, and how came it to be called Mānavan ?</p>
23976 <p>§ 55. The word {@mánu@} originally means simply ‘man’ (see vocabulary). As
23977 we speak of human beings as the ‘children of men,’ so the Rig-veda speaks of them
23978 as the ‘offspring of man’ ({@mánu@}); and in this way arose the conception of a personal
23979 Mánu, the father of mankind. He is, in fact, the heros eponymos of the human race.</p>
23980 <p>In the Veda^1^ he appears as ‘Father Manu, child of the Sun,’ as a holy seer, the
23981 originator of prayer, praise, and sacrifice, and as the object of the special favor of
23982 the gods. In the Brāhmaṇas, Manu is the progenitor of the new race after the flood.
23983 That he was regarded as a type of wisdom, is evidenced by the ancient saw, ‘What-
23984 ever Manu said, that is medicine’ (TS. ii. 2. 10^2^). And again, that he was an eminent
23985 type of goodness appears from the fact that his actions came to be looked upon as
23986 <note n="340-1"><p>For the Vedic legend of his birth, see 85^15^N. The
23987 ancillary books make Manu the author of RV. viii.

[Page341+ 47]
23990 examples highly worthy of imitation. Thus the Veda says (TS. iii. 1. 9^4^), ‘Manu
23991 divided his property among his sons’; and this is quoted by Baudhāyana in his
23992 Dharma-sūtra as such an example. Such simple beginnings are entirely natural; but
23993 they are also sufficient to show how, with the growth of legal literature, the authors
23994 of law-books came to cite all kinds of (supposititious) sayings and doings of Manu as
23995 authoritative precedent. For, after the custom of referring to Manu as authority
23996 was once started, the oftener he was thus cited, the greater his factitious authority
23997 and the temptation to cite him would become. Accordingly, if we examine the four
23998 oldest Dharma-sūtras, we find much more frequent reference to Manu in Vasiṣṭha,
23999 the latest of them, than in Gautama, the oldest. And thus, at last, what had been
24000 a mere name, a part of the traditional inheritance of the mythical past, attained to
24001 greatness as a personal authority and actual law-giver.</p>
24002 <p>§ 56. Before proceeding to our other questions, let us rehearse briefly the native
24003 account of the origin of the work. In Sanskrit, the book is entitled {@mānava;@} and
24004 this may mean either ‘of Manu’ or ‘of the Mānavans.’ The Hindus say, ‘of Manu’;
24005 and accordingly the opening stanzas represent the great sages as approaching ‘Manu,
24006 the son of the Self-existent,’ and asking him to declare unto them the law. He
24007 accedes; but deems it necessary to go back to a time before the Creation, in order
24008 to show how he derives his lineage (Manu i. 33), and hence also his authority,
24009 directly from the Supreme One, Brahmán. ‘He,’ says Manu (i. 58-60), ‘composed
24010 this law-book, and taught it to me alone in the beginning; I taught it to Bhṛgu;
24011 and Bhṛgu will recite it to you.’</p>
24012 <p>Bhṛgu accordingly takes up Manu's cosmogonical discourse, continues with an
24013 account of the Four Ages and of other matters, dwells on the excellence of Manu's
24014 Laws, and ends book first with a table of contents of the twelve books of which
24015 the treatise consists. And in order that we may not forget that it is all (or all but
24016 i. 1-60) put into the mouth of Bhṛgu, we are frequently reminded of the situation
24017 by an ‘I will next declare’ or the like, especially at the beginning of books v. and
24018 xii., where Bhṛgu is mentioned by name as the promulgator of the laws in question.
24019 In accordance with all this, the work is entitled the Bhṛgu-saṃhitā of the Mānava-
24020 dharma-śāstra, and it may conveniently be so designated. It contains 2685 ślokas
24021 or 5370 lines; compare 54^11^N.</p>
24022 <p>§ 57. For the incredibility of this native account the reasons are near at hand.
24023 First, all the passages involving Bhṛgu as promulgator of the work can be separated
24024 from the rest as easily as a picture-frame from the canvas which it surrounds.
24025 Indeed, the entire first book is a most palpable later addition. And, more than this,
24026 Bhṛgu himself is cited (at iii. 16), with three others, as an authority on a disputed
24027 point. Clearly, the later editors of the work were nodding here; else they would
24028 have expunged this stanza. And who knows how many more of a like sort they
24029 may have expunged ?</p>
24030 <p>Moreover, against the claim that Manu (to say nothing of the Supreme Spirit),
24031 was the author and the first law-giver, the case is equally plain. For the work
24032 appeals to the authority of Manu here and there, just as the other works of its class
24033 do, thus showing that its earlier editors at least did not pretend that Manu was the
24034 author of the whole. Nor was he a law-giver without predecessors or rivals; else
24035 we should not find, as we do, divergent opinions of other ancient sages cited along
24036 with what purports to be his. Moreover, the work itself (ii. 6 = 58^14^f) admits that
[Page342+ 56]
24037 the law is based on the Veda, the usage of virtuous men, etc.; and it plainly men-
24038 tions (at iii. 232) Dharma-śāstras, which must be either contemporaneous, or else
24039 earlier than itself.</p>
24040 <p>§ 58. Secondly, then, What was the real origin of the work ? The first half of
24041 the answer is as follows. The Vedic works, as explained below, fall into the three
24042 classes of Saṃhitā, Brāhmaṇa, and Sūtra. Chief among the works of the last class is
24043 the Kalpa-sūtra, or ‘Ceremony-rules.’ No Kalpa work had catholic validity among
24044 all Brahman families. On the contrary, many of the most important old families
24045 had each its own Kalpa-sūtra. In these clannish differences, doubtless, originated
24046 the Caraṇas or ‘Schools,’ in which Brahman science was cultivated and sacred tradi-
24047 tion handed down from generation to generation. Thus among the adherents of the
24048 Black Yajur-veda, we find the family of Āpastamba; and, bearing his name, we find
24049 not only a Brāhmaṇa, but also a complete Kalpa-sūtra in its three subdivisions
24050 of Śrauta-sūtra or ‘Rules for the fire-sacrifices,’ Gṛhya-sūtra or ‘Domestic usages,’
24051 and Dharma-sūtra or ‘Sacred law.’ The Kalpa-sūtra of Baudhāyana doubtless had
24052 a similar make-up. Good editions of various Gṛhya- and Dharma-sūtras are now
24053 accessible in text and translation. They treat^1^ of the sacraments, of the duties of a
24054 Brahman in the various stages of his life, as student, householder, hermit, beggar,
24055 of the duties of a king, of the law of inheritance, and so on.</p>
24056 <p>Now these are the very subjects treated also in the Dharma-śāstras. But there
24057 is one great difference, the difference of form. The Sūtras are in mingled prose and
24058 verse, the latter including both {@triṣṭubh@} and {@anuṣṭubh@} stanzas; while the Śāstras are
24059 in the ordinary epic {@śloka.@} To a mind acquainted with the veriest rudiments of
24060 criticism it is quite clear from their form and language alone that the Śāstras are
24061 later than the Sūtras--a view which is in entire accord with the stanza ii. 6 = 58^14^,
24062 cited above. The conclusion, then, that the Dharma-śāstras, in general, as shown by
24063 their contents and form, are the outgrowth, by a very natural process of evolution,
24064 from the Dharma-sūtras, is unimpeached.</p>
24065 <p>§ 59. The other half of our answer is that the Mānava-dharma-śāstra, in par-
24066 ticular, is a later metrical recast of a lost Mānava-dharma-sūtra: in other words, that it
24067 is the ‘Law-book of the Mānavans.’ This is a particular thesis, quite different from
24068 the general conclusion just stated; and, although very widely accepted, it is not
24069 universally so. The theory^2^ of this connection proceeds as follows. Among the
24070 schools of the Black Yajur-veda, especially among those of the Maitrāyaṇīya branch
24071 thereof, we find the school of the Mānavans.^3^ According to the investigations of
24072 Dr. von Schröder,^4^ the Maitrāyaṇīya seems to have been one of the oldest and most
24073 important of all the schools of the Yajus-period.^5^ Of these Maitrāyaṇīyas there are
24074 still some representatives surviving in Western India; and their Sūtras are entitled
24075 Mānava-sūtras. Manuscripts of the Mānava-śrauta-sūtra and the Mānava-gṛhya-
24076 sūtra are still extant.^6^</p>
24077 <p>§ 60. Unfortunately, the Mānava-dharma-sūtra, the link most important to
24078 connect our Bhṛgu-saṃhitā with the Vedic schools, is still missing. The researches
24079 <note n="342-1"><p>Compare p. 358, § 96f, below.</p></note>
24080 <note n="342-2"><p>This theory was broached by Weber (ISt. i. 69)

[Page343+ 51]
24093 of von Bradke,^1^ too, failed to show any striking correspondences between the
24094 Mānava-gṛhya-sūtra and our treatise. But, on the other hand, Bühler has dis-
24095 covered^2^ important correspondences between it and the Mānava-śrāddha-kalpa.
24096 Moreover, as has been repeatedly pointed out,^3^ the Dharma-sūtra of Vasiṣṭha con-
24097 tains a quotation (iv. 5-8) which has every appearance of being a veritable fragment
24098 of the original Mānava-dharma-sūtra. In this quotation we have, first, the prose
24099 rule (5); next, the stanzas which support it (6, 7), and which agree entirely or
24100 nearly with Manu v. 41 and 48; and, last, a Vedic passage (8) to support both rule
24101 and stanzas. This is the arrangement usual in the Dharma-sūtras. And the prose
24102 rule (5) is characterized by the words iti {@mānavam@} as a quotation from the Sūtra
24103 of a special school; for works valid for all Aryans are not so cited.^4^</p>
24104 <p>§ 61. Other quotations^5^ are found in Vasiṣṭha at iii. 2, xiii. 16, xix. 37, and xx. 18,
24105 in close correspondence respectively with Manu ii. 168, iv. 117, x. 120, and xi. 152 of
24106 our text, and introduced by the formula, ‘And on this point they quote a Mānavan
24107 stanza.’ From this, one might think that Vasiṣṭha was quoting from our Bhṛgu-
24108 saṃhitā. But this inference is barred by the evident posteriority of our text, as
24109 shown by its form and by other general considerations, and in particular by the fact
24110 that the stanza at xix. 37 is in the {@triṣṭubh@} metre. We conclude, then, that the
24111 Mānava-dharma-sūtra known to Vasiṣṭha closely resembled our text, but was not
24112 identical with it.</p>
24113 <p>§ 62. Now granting all that precedes, there is a very strong inherent probability
24114 in the conclusion that our Bhṛgu-saṃhitā is a metrical recast of the Dharma-sūtra
24115 of the Mānavan school. More than this cannot be said; for it is not a necessary
24116 conclusion. Its probability, however, has been greatly increased by the considerations
24117 respecting the occasion and method of the recast adduced by Bühler.</p>
24118 <p>§ 63. The occasion was the development (beside the sectarian schools which
24119 studied exclusively a single branch of the Veda and the rudimentary works ancillary
24120 thereto) of the non-sectarian schools of special sciences, whose teachings claimed
24121 validity for all Aryans. In the old Vedic schools, the pupils had to learn the texts
24122 of the Mantras and Brāhmaṇas of their sect, and the short ancillary treatises, on
24123 ritual, etymology, metre, etc., called Aṅgas or ‘Limbs’ of the Veda. With the
24124 development of these subjects to elaborate disciplines, it became impossible for a
24125 student to master them all. He must either content himself with a thorough verbal
24126 but unintelligent acquaintance with the texts and short treatises of his own sect; or
24127 else he must become a specialist in the ritual, the law, or some other subject, and
24128 renounce an extensive knowledge of the sacred texts.</p>
24129 <p>§ 64. That this truly describes the course of things is shown by the present
24130 state of learning in India. A good Vaidik is able to recite all the texts of his branch
24131 of the Veda. But in order to have an elaborate sacrifice performed, there is need of
24132 a Śrotriya specialist, who, though ignorant of the other Aṅgas, is yet a master of
24133 the ritual. In the case of two of the Aṅgas, grammar and astronomy, the Vedic
24134 schools possess no sectarian text-books of their own. These subjects, it would seem,
24135 had been abandoned to the specialists at an early period. For a good while longer
24136 the sacred law was cultivated in the Vedic schools, as appears from the existence of
24137 <note n="343-1"><p>In the ZDMG. xxxvi. 417-77 (1882).</p></note>
24138 <note n="343-2"><p>Bühler's {%Manu,%} p. xlf.</p></note>

24143 SBE. xiv. p. xviii-xx.</p></note>
[Page344+ 47]
24144 the numerous sectarian manuals on the subject. But even in these (see Bühler,
24145 {%Manu,%} p. lii, p. xxv, N. 3) we find mention of persons who know several different law-
24146 books, that is, who were specialists in the law. And this fact alone would lead us
24147 to infer the existence of special law-schools.</p>
24148 <p>§ 65. Granting the existence of these schools, we have precisely the combination
24149 of circumstances which would lead to the production of such a work as our Manu-
24150 text. The schools had before them plenty of Sūtra-material, sectarian, of only local
24151 validity, unsystematic, and incomplete. In the very nature of things, the schools
24152 would tend to be non-sectarian, to widen their influence, and to systematize and com-
24153 plete the work of their predecessors. And this is exactly what they have done in our
24154 Manu-text. It is absolutely non-sectarian. As contrasted with its forerunners, it
24155 emphasizes the practical rather than the moral side of the law, treating strictly legal
24156 topics at much greater length. It shows the signs of being a school-book. And
24157 finally, it aims at general validity among all Aryans. This explains the fact that
24158 our Manu shows so little correspondence with the texts of the Vedic Mānavan
24159 schools. The recast was the work of men whose interest in their subject exceeded
24160 their interest in a sect.</p>
24161 <p>§ 66. Finally, the greatness of the name of the legendary and semi-divine Manu
24162 suggests the reason why a special law-school should have chosen the Mānavan
24163 Dharma-sūtra rather than any other as the basis of their new manual. In con-
24164 structing a treatise that aspired to universal acceptance, they must {%ipso facto%} with-
24165 draw any claim thereto which rested on the high standing of the Sūtra-original as a
24166 sectarian work. The problem then was, in accomplishing this task, to avoid too
24167 violent a break with tradition. Had they taken the Gautama-sūtra, and recast it,
24168 waiving for it all claim to general validity on the score of Gautama's authority, it
24169 would indeed have been a bold proceeding to father it upon Vyāsa or Manu or any
24170 of the great sages of yore. By choosing the Mānava-sūtra, after their silent waiver
24171 on the one hand, they had only, on the other, to interpret its title expressly as
24172 meaning ‘of Manu,’ when,--presto--without the smallest offense to tradition or
24173 grammar, they had a name of unsurpassed authority to commend their work to the
24174 Aryan world.</p>
24175 <p>§ 67. A great deal of the recast--Bühler, p. lxxiii, thinks one half--cannot
24176 have been derived from the Sūtra-original. The entire first book is most clearly such
24177 a later addition; and such is likewise the twelfth book, whose classification of actions
24178 and existences according to the three {@guṇas@} (66^8^f) is based on the teachings of the
24179 Sāṃkhya, Yoga, and Vedānta systems of philosophy.</p>
24180 <p>What now is the source of these later additions ? The Mahā-bhārata offers very
24181 many correspondences with our Manu-text. A comparative study of the two works
24182 shows that the editors of the latter have not drawn on the former, but rather that
24183 both works have drawn upon a common stock of popular metrical maxims (Hopkins,
24184 JAOS. xi. 268), which embodied much of the traditional legal lore, and were ascribed
24185 (as is attested by extant inscriptions) now to one and now to another of the ancient
24186 mythical sages--Vyāsa, Manu, and the rest.</p>
24187 <p>§ 68. As for the method of conversion of the Sūtra into our Manu-text, Pro-
24188 fessor Bühler is of opinion (p. xcii) that it took place at one time, and that our text
24189 is not the result of many successive recasts.</p>
24190 <p>§ 69. Coming, finally, to the date of the recast, Professor Bühler concludes
[Page345-a+ 58]
24191 (p. cxiv, cxvii) that it existed in the second century A. D., and was made between
24192 that time and circa 100 B. C. General considerations make this conclusion seem far
24193 from improbable. Our Manu-text is doubtless the oldest of the class of secondary
24194 law-books, like those of Yājñavalkya and Nārada, to which it belongs (p. civ). And
24195 again, while it is doubtless posterior to the older portions of the Mahā-bhārata, our
24196 Manu-text--in some form or other--is probably prior to the later portions of the
24197 great Epic, books xii. and xiii. But we do not know the time of Yājñavalkya nor
24198 of the Epic; and at present it seems quite vain to seek for an accurate date.</p>

24914 <p>§ 71. For grammatical forms pecullar to the Veda,
24915 reference to Whitney will be made when needful;
24916 but the student should read systematically the sec-
24917 tions that describe Vedic noun-inflection and verb-
24918 conjugation. For the former subject, the small-print
24919 lines of 330, 340, and 342 are important; and for the
24920 latter, the paragraphs on the subjunctive, 557-563,
24921 736, 700, and those on the mode-forms of the different
24922 aorists, chap. xi. The accent, explained by Whitney,
24923 80-86, is important for the exegesis and otherwise.
24924 The accent-rules are given at 92-97, 314-320, 591-598,
24925 1082-86. The qotation of the accent is explained at
24926 87-90.</p>
24927 <p>§ 72. The Vedic literature is based on the songs of the early Aryan tribes
24928 immigrant into India. These tribes were life-loving, brave, and warlike, and show
24929 their nature clearly in their songs. But they were remarkable above all for the
24930 strength of their religious instinct. This is a cardinal fact--the prime determinant
24931 of the character of the early Indian literature; for that literature is one of prevail-
24932 ingly religious content. The Veda is thus distinguished from the later literature
24933 of the Epic and the Classical periods by its contents, and also--no less--by its
24934 language and style. But within itself, the Vedic literature (or “Veda” in the
24935 broader sense of the word) shows differences which serve to divide it into three
24936 great groups.</p>
24937 <p>§ 73. To assign a definite chronological period for each of these groups is
24938 neither feasible nor necessary.^1^ But it is interesting and quite possible to establish
24939 an inner chronologic sequence among the groups themselves and the sub-groups, and
24940 even among individual books and parts of books. To the first group belong the
24941 ancient songs themselves, which are in metrical form and are known as the Vedic
24942 hymns or Mantras. The term “Veda” is often used in a narrower sense to denote
24943 them. To the second belong the Brāhmaṇas, the oldest Indo-European prose extant,
24944 which presuppose and are dependent on the Mantra-literature. The third group
24945 comprehends the Sūtras, collections of brief rules upon liturgical and other subjects,
24946 which, in turn, presuppose both of the foregoing groups.</p>
24947 <note n="352-1"><p>Indeed, to do so would give a very false impres-
24948 sion. The periods overlap; and the styles of litera-
24949 ture shade off from one into another--so, for
24950 example, in the Yajurveda.</p></note>
[Page353+ 55]
24951 <p>§ 74. A great mass of Mantra-material originated and was handed down by
24952 memorial tradition orally from generation to generation long before the existence
24953 of any such collections of Mantras as have come down to us.^1^ The Mantras fall into
24954 several different classes. To one belongs the hymn-stanza (ṛ́c); to another, the
24955 sacrificial formula ({@yájus@}); and to another, the magic charm ({@bráhman@}). From the
24956 stock of Mantras of one class--for example, the {@yájus@}--a certain collection with
24957 definite arrangement became established by popular usage in a certain community,
24958 and thus arose a Veda, for example, a Yajurveda--not a certain definite book, but
24959 some one of many possible and probable collections of Mantras of a certain definite
24960 class. From the same stock of the same class another collection was formed in
24961 another community, and thus arose another Veda, for example, another Yajurveda.
24962 The period in which the oldest hymns of the Rigveda originated may be set back
24963 into the second pre-Christian millennium;^2^ but this only on certain general con-
24964 siderations--not as a matter of precise argumentation. Geographically, the early
24965 Vedic Aryans may be referred to Kābul and the Panjāb.^3^</p>
24966 <p>§ 75. The Mantras have come down to us, for the most part, in several collec-
24967 tions, diverse in form and purpose. There was, besides, more or less Mantra-material
24968 which was never embodied in any collection,^4^ but of which we find remnants scattered
24969 about in various books. The great collections of Mantras are the Rigveda, the
24970 Sāmaveda, the Yajurveda, and the Atharvaveda. The text of the Mantras forms
24971 what is often called a Saṃhitā. To each Saṃhitā is attached a body of dependent
24972 or ancillary works of the Brāhmaṇa and Sūtra groups: so that the oldest Indian
24973 books are classed, first, according to the Veda to which they belong; and, secondly,
24974 according to their character as Mantra, Brāhmaṇa, or Sūtra. It is to be remembered
24975 that “Veda” has a narrower and a broader sense, and that “Rigveda,” for instance,
24976 may mean either the Rigveda-saṃhitā or also the entire body of works belonging to
24977 that Veda.</p>
24978 <p>§ 76. The Saṃhitā of the Rigveda is a historical^5^ collection. It consists of
24979 1017 hymns, each containing on an average about ten double lines,^6^ so that the text is
24980 in volume somewhat less than that of the two Homeric poems together. There is
24981 a purely external and mechanical division of the text into ‘Eighths,’ ‘Lessons,’^7^
24982 ‘Groups,’ and ‘Stanzas’ ({@aṣṭaka, adhyāya, varga, ṛc@}); but this need not specially
24983 concern us now. Of deep historical significance is the other division into ‘Books,’
24984 ‘Chapters,’ ‘Hymns,’ and ‘Stanzas’ ({@maṇḍala, anuvāka, sūkta, ṛc@}).</p>
24985 <p>§ 77. There are ten ‘Books’ (literally, ‘Circles’). And of these, books ii. to
24986 viii. are the so-called “Family-books”--that is, they contain each the hymns
24987 ascribed to a single family or clan, in which they doubtless originated, and by which
24988 they were handed down as a sacred inheritance. Thus, book ii. contains the hymns
24989 of Gṛtsamada and his clan. Those of Viśvāmitra and his tribe follow in book iii.;
24990 and then in order those of Vāmadeva (book iv.), Atri (book v.), Bharadvāja (book
24991 vi.), Vasiṣṭha (book vii.), and Kaṇva (book viii.). The ninth book is made up of

25007 to very different authors;^1^ while the first consists of fifteen^2^ minor groups, each
25008 attributed to some ancient poet-sage.</p>
25009 <p>§ 78. The general history of the text of the Rigveda was touched upon by Pro-
25010 fessor Roth in a very instructive little essay^3^ entitled {%Vedische Studien.%} Some of
25011 his conclusions may be briefly stated. The assembling of the Mantras into a collec-
25012 tion was accomplished by the aid of writing.^4^ The first Rik collections were probably
25013 single books and parts of books, each an aggregation of material of such moderate
25014 compass as to be easily handled by a single collector. The small collections were
25015 later united into one large collection, which, completed by the addition of books ix.
25016 and x., and uniformly edited, constitutes our RV. Saṃhitā.</p>
25017 <p>§ 79. Roth recognizes three stages in the tradition: 1. the oral transmission
25018 from the authors to the time of the collectors; 2. the reduction from the oral form
25019 to the written form; and 3. the transmission of the written text to us. We may
25020 admit that in the last stage the text--carefully preserved as it was, see § 98--has
25021 suffered no very important corruptions. The collectors themselves, however, did
25022 not by any means write down the texts precisely as they heard them. The reciters
25023 from memory must have recited rhythmically. The collectors (writers--redactors
25024 or diaskeuasts) have often destroyed the rhythm by putting the texts into the
25025 strait-jacket of the rules of grammar, and especially by writing the words accord-
25026 ing to the later rules of {@saṃdhi.@} To the first stage are to be referred the many
25027 mistakes which are ascribable to carelessness in listening,^5^ and which may be called
25028 blunders of the ear rather than of the eye.</p>
25029 <p>§ 80. That the hymns themselves are of diverse origin, both in respect of place
25030 and of time, is probable {%a priori%} and is shown by internal evidence.^6^ Accordingly,
25031 if we find, for example, two hymns involving inconsistent conceptions of the same
25032 deity or of different deities, this is to be deemed quite natural, inasmuch as they
25033 originated among clans dwelling in diverse regions. Moreover, after the aggregation
25034 of the small collections into the large one, interpolations and later additions were
25035 still made. To discriminate between the different elements that now make up the
25036 canonical Vedic text is therefore an important problem.</p>
25037 <p>§ 81. Again, in the course of time, and in part as a result of the wrangling
25038 pedantry of narrow teachers, the stock collections became ramified into slightly
25039 divergent recensions. These were called {@śākhās@} or ‘branches,’ because so related to
25040 each other as are different branches from the same tree-stock. The Śākhās often
25041 supply to criticism the various readings for which the classical philologist looks to
25042 good and independent manuscripts. The community in which such a Śākhā attained
25043 definitive authority was called a {@caraṇa@} or ‘school.’ There once existed, presumably,
25044 many branches and schools^7^ of the RV. The school of the Śākalas,^8^ however, seems
25045 <note n="354-1"><p>The orthodox Hindu conception of the hymns is
25046 that they had existed from eternity; it recognizes no
25047 human authors. The Hindus do not call Atri, for
25048 example, the “author” of a given hymn, but rather
25049 the “Rishi,” i. e. the “seer,” who was so fortunate
25050 as to “see” it the last time it was revealed.--Müller,
25051 ASL. p. 95.</p></note>

25055 <note n="354-4"><p>This is entirely consistent with the facts that the

25066 to have gained exclusive predominance, and the extant recension of the RV. Saṃhitā
25067 bears their name. The Śākhā of the Bāṣkalas is also mentioned.</p>
25068 <p>§ 82. The manuscripts of the RV. Saṃhitā exhibit almost no diversities of
25069 reading; so that, in the absence of {@śākhā@}-differences, the criticism of the text has
25070 to rest on intrinsic evidence, and on a comparison of the other Saṃhitās, and on a
25071 study of the RV. citations in the RV. Brāhmaṇas and Sūtras. Other criteria have
25072 been brought to light by the study of the arrangement of the collection. Thus,
25073 within each of the books ii.-vii., the hymns addressed to the same deity are grouped
25074 together and arranged according to the decreasing number of stanzas of each hymn.
25075 The same simple principle goes farther, governing, for example, the order of the
25076 groups within a book.^1^ Violations of the principle may arouse suspicion as to the
25077 originality or genuineness of the passages concerned.</p>
25078 <p>§ 83. The first written form of the text would seem to have been the {@saṃhitā-@}
25079 {@pāṭha@} or ‘combined reading,’ wherein the words are combined according to the more or
25080 less artificial rules of grammar.^2^ These combinations often admit of several different
25081 resolutions. To obviate the resulting uncertainties, there was constructed the {@pada-@}
25082 {@pāṭha@} or ‘word-reading,’ which aims to give each word in its true independent form
25083 without reference to any rules of combination. The Pada-text of the published RV.
25084 is attributed to Śākalya,^3^ and is the oldest conscious exegetical work upon the Veda
25085 now known. It is far from infallible.^4^ For its secondary use, see § 98N.</p>
25086 <p>§ 84. The Sāmaveda is a Veda of {@sā́mans.@} A {@sāman@} is properly a ‘tune’--
25087 not a text; but in this connection the word means an {@ṛc@} so modified^5^ as to be better
25088 adapted for chanting, especially during the ceremonies of the Soma-sacrifice. Of
25089 the 1549 stanzas of the Sāmaveda, 1474 occur also in the Rigveda.^6^ The SV.
25090 exhibits many variations from the readings of the RV. Saṃhitā, some of which
25091 are of value for the criticism of the latter text.^7^ In general, the relations of the
25092 SV. to the RV. still present many difficult problems.^8^</p>
25093 <p>§ 85. The Saṃhitā of the Atharvaveda, as compared with that of the RV.,
25094 represents a lower plane of life and thought, as it is also later in respect of form
25095 and language. It contains magic incantations for the warding off of the most
25096 diverse malign influences, and prayers and charms for success in the various affairs
25097 of life, as love, gaming, quarrels, journeys, and the like. It has a high degree of
25098 interest for the student of popular superstitions. The Saṃhitā has come down to us
25099 in at least two recensions. The one is called the Paippalāda Śākhā.^9^ The other was
25100 published in 1856 by Roth and Whitney.^10^ About a sixteenth part of the RV. stanzas
25101 occur also--with more or less interesting variants--in books i. to xix. of this text.

25127 formulas (see {@yajus@} in vocab.) which accompanied the sacrificial ceremonials, and
25128 are, as it were, the hand-books of the {@adhvaryus@} or priests who did the actual
25129 manual labor of the sacrifices.^1^ With the growth of ritualism and its spread over
25130 a wide extent of territory^2^ there naturally grew up many differing usages in con-
25131 nection with the sacrifice, and many centres of ritualistic study.^3^ In this wise it
25132 happened that the sectarian schools of the Yajurveda were especially numerous and
25133 flourishing.</p>
25134 <p>§ 87. The Black Yajurveda. The various schools of this, the older Yajurveda,
25135 bear the names of men reputed to be the pupils--directly or indirectly--of Vaiśam-
25136 pāyana, a name great in the Epos. At least five schools^4^ possessed special Saṃhitās,
25137 of which four are still extant: to wit, the Saṃhitā of the Kaṭhas (<gr></gr>) or the
25138 Kāṭhaka; that of the Kapiṣṭhala-Kaṭhas (<gr></gr>); that of the Maitrāyaṇīyas;
25139 and that of the school of Āpastamba, a subdivision of the Taittirīyas. The one last
25140 mentioned, the Taittirīya Saṃhitā, was the first to be printed in a scholarly edition.^5^
25141 The Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā has recently been published by Dr. L. von Schröder, Leip-
25142 zig, 1881-86. The others are still unedited. In all these texts of the old Yajus
25143 Saṃhitās, the sacred formulas are commingled with prose passages, explanatory and
25144 prescriptive. A single such passage is a {@Brā́hmaṇa,^6^@} ‘the dictum of a {@brahmán@} {%or%}
25145 priest,’ ‘a priestly discourse.’</p>
25146 <p>§ 88. The White Yajurveda. To remedy this confusion, a new school of
25147 Adhvaryus, called the Vājasaneyins, arranged a Saṃhitā of ‘clear formulas’ ({@śuklāni@}
25148 {@yajūṃṣi@}), i. e. a text in which the formulas or Mantras were separated from the
25149 priestly discourses or Brāhmaṇas.^7^ Not without some little animus, doubtless, they
25150 turned to account the double meaning of {@śukla,@} ‘clear’ or ‘white,’ and fixed the
25151 name of “Dark” ({@kṛṣṇa,@} ‘dark’ or ‘black’) upon the mingled or uncleared texts of
25152 their older rivals. The Saṃhitā of the White Yajurveda or Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā has
25153 come down to us in the recension of the Kāṇvas and in that of the Mādhyaṃdinas,^8^
25154 and was published by Weber, Berlin, 1849-52.</p>
25155 <p>§ 89. The separate collections of the formulas naturally suggested a similar
25156 treatment of the priestly discourses. In the school of the Vājasaneyins, the result
25157 of this treatment was a collection of the formerly detached {@Brā́hmaṇas,@} which collec-
25158 tion is itself also called a {@Brā́hmaṇa,^9^@} and is practically an encyclopedic digest of the
25159 wisdom of their school.^10^</p>
25160 <p>§ 90. The oldest collection of Mantras, the Rigveda, is in the main the reflex
25161 of the life of a vigorous, active, and healthy people--a people that prayed most for
25162 length of days, for sturdy sons, abundant cattle, doughty retainers, and victory over
25163 their enemies; a people whose religion was a simple worship of the deified powers
25164 of nature. But even during the Vedic period, there comes a profound change. The
25165 Yajurveda represents a turning-point in the development of the Hindu character.
25166 The centre of Vedic life is shifted to Madhyadeśa; and here were made the first

25183 great advances in the arts and institutions of civilization, in trade, and in science.
25184 Here also priestly families and warrior-families attained to such importance as to
25185 assert their independence of the people, and so bring about the strongly marked
25186 class-distinctions that grew into the rigid system of caste. And here, with the
25187 waxing power of the priesthood, the old Vedic religion was converted into an
25188 infinitely complex system of sacrifices and ceremonies. To this period belongs the
25189 belief in metempsychosis--a dreadful and universal reality to the Hindu mind.
25190 With the growing tendency of the Hindu character towards introspection comes the
25191 system of hermit-life and the asceticism which are so prominent in the Hindu
25192 Middle Age, and which in turn led naturally to the habit of theosophic speculation.
25193 The sultry air of Ganges-land has relaxed both the physical and the mental fibre of
25194 the Hindu, and he has become a Quietist.</p>
25195 <p>§ 91. The Hindu character has been transformed almost beyond recognition.
25196 The change is wonderful. It would be also incomprehensible, but for the literature
25197 of the Brāhmaṇas.^1^ As a whole and by themselves, they are puerile, arid, inane.
25198 But as the sole and faithful reflex of an immensely important phase in the develop-
25199 ment of an ethnic type, they have a great interest--an interest heightened by the
25200 fact that the annals of human evolution hardly present another type whose history
25201 can be studied through so many centuries in unbroken continuity.</p>
25202 <p>§ 92. The sacerdotal class, ever magnifying its office, has invested the sacrifice
25203 with a most exaggerated importance and sanctity. The sacrifice has become the
25204 central point of the Brahman's life and thought. About it he has spun a flimsy web
25205 of mystery, and in each of its events he sees a hidden symbolism.^2^ Everything is
25206 not only that which it {%is%} but also that which it {%signifies.%} So lost is the Brahman in
25207 these esoteric vagaries that to him the line of demarcation between “is” and “signi-
25208 fies” becomes almost wholly obliterated.^3^ What we deem the realities of life are as
25209 pale shadows. The sacrifice and its events are the real facts, and to fathom their
25210 mysteries^4^ is omnipotence and salvation.</p>
25211 <p>§ 93. It must not be forgotten that the phases of development represented by
25212 the Mantras and Brāhmaṇas are not separated by hard and fast lines. The oldest
25213 Yajus texts are of the transition type. They are called Saṃhitās, and contain
25214 indeed Mantras in abundance; but the Mantras are mingled with prose passages
25215 which are the first Brāhmaṇas. Descriptions of the sacrificial ceremonies, attribu-
25216 tions to them of hidden meanings, accounts of their origin, legends to illustrate their
25217 efficacy--such are the contents of the older Brāhmaṇas. Conscious philosophic
25218 speculation plays a subordinate part: its beginnings we can trace to the RV.
25219 Saṃhitā;^5^ but the great mass of it is contained in the later Brāhmaṇa literature.</p>
25220 <p>§ 94. In this, the later Brāhmaṇa period, the descriptions of the ritual are
25221 relegated to systematic treatises (§ 95); and the theosophic and philosophic passages
25222 become more lengthy and important, and receive--as containing material appro-
25223 priate for the meditations of the <gr></gr> or Forest-hermits--the special names of
25224 Āraṇyakas^6^ or ‘Forest-treatises’ and Upaniṣads.^7^ Some of the best of these have

25238 been handed down by tradition as separate works with separate names; and other
25239 tracts of the same general style and contents have been written; but it must be
25240 remembered that the original Āraṇyakas and Upaniṣads were integral parts of the
25241 digested Brāhmaṇas.^1^</p>
25242 <p>Brahmanical speculation culminates in pessimistic Pantheism, in the doctrine of
25243 the misery of all earthly existence, from which we can hope for redemption only
25244 through reabsorption into the universal All-in-One. This is the result of Brahmanical
25245 thought, on which as a foundation was built up the doctrine and order of Buddha;
25246 this the link that unites the Brahmanic and the Buddhistic chains of development.^2^</p>
25247 <p>§ 95. The Brāhmaṇas presuppose a thorough acquaintance with the course and
25248 details of the sacrifice, and do not undertake a systematic exposition thercof. But
25249 when the ceremonies had grown to tremendous length and complexity, it became
25250 necessary to have manuals giving full and orderly directions for the use of the
25251 celebrant. Such works are the ‘Rules for the sacrifices’ or Śrauta-sūtras, so called
25252 because they stand in most intimate relation to the Veda or ‘sacred texts’ ({@śruti@}),
25253 and continually cite these texts, and prescribe the manner and the occasions of their
25254 employment with the various ceremonies.</p>
25255 <p>§ 96. Usage and observance, crystallized into sacred ceremony, invest the whole
25256 life of an Aryan Hindu--nay, even his pre-natal and post-mortem existence. These
25257 usages differed considerably in different localities, and in the lesser details among
25258 the different families of the same locality. In part, perhaps, to counteract the
25259 tendency to diversity, books were made describing the observances recognized as
25260 normal in a certain school or community. They are called Gṛhya-sūtras, or ‘Rules
25261 of domestic usages.’ Here, too, as well as in the sacrifice, everything proceeds with
25262 the recitation of Mantras; so that these books also attach themselves to certain
25263 Vedas or Vedic schools. The legitimate subjects of these Rules are the ‘Sacraments’
25264 ({@saṃskāras@}), and the ‘Simple-sacrifices’ ({@pāka-yajñas@}) of the householder.</p>
25265 <p>§ 97. There is also a third class of Sūtras, called Dharma-sūtras, which pre-
25266 scribe rules for the every-day life of those who would conform to the example of the
25267 virtuous. Since they have to do with ‘agreement-conduct,’ i. e. the ‘conduct’ ({@ācāra@})
25268 which has for its norm the ‘agreement’ ({@sam-aya,@} lit. ‘con-vention’) of those who
25269 know the law, they are also called Sāmayācārika-sūtras. The matters belonging
25270 more properly to the Gṛhya-sūtras are sometimes treated also in the Dharma-sūtras.
25271 But the legitimate subjects of the latter are far more varied than those of the former.
25272 They embrace all sorts of injunctions and restrictions relating to etiquette, to
25273 eating and sleeping, to purification and penance, and to the details of the daily life
25274 of the student and householder and hermit, and even extend to the duties of the
25275 king and to the beginnings of civil and criminal law. In the order of development
25276 they are plainly posterior to the Gṛhya-sūtras.</p>
25277 <p>§ 98. As the sacred texts of the Mantras grew in sanctity, their dialect and
25278 style of thought became obsolescent. For the transmission of the sacred lore, a
25279 learned apparatus became necessary. To preserve the written text of a given
25280 ‘branch’ ({@śākhā@}) of the Veda from any change in “one jot or one tittle,” by
25281 establishing the relations of the {@saṃhitā@} and {@pada pāṭhas@} (§ 83) of that branch,
25282 there were composed the phonetic treatises, which, because attaching each ‘to a

[Page359-a+ 61]
25287 (certain) branch’ ({@prati-śākham@}), are called Prātiśākhyas.^1^ These give with the
25288 utmost minuteness of detail the rules for the retroversion of the {@pada@} to the {@saṃhitā@}
25289 readings, and thus enable us to establish with great accuracy the text as it was
25290 in their day.^2^</p>
25291 <p>§ 99. To preserve the knowledge of the sense of obsolescent words, there were
25292 made collections of synonyms and of hard words (<gr></gr>), called the Nighaṇṭavas, the
25293 oldest Vedic Glossary. Upon the Glossary there was written, by the ancient sage
25294 Yāska, a comment called Nirukta, which is the oldest extant work of formal Vedic
25295 exegesis, but which itself acknowledges a number of predecessors. Among its
25296 successors, the most famous is the great commentary of Sāyaṇa^3^ Ācārya, ca. 1350 A. D.
25297 The Anukramaṇīs are little works which give the divinity, the “seer,” and the
25298 metre of each hymn of a Saṃhitā.</p>

25591 from man.</p>
25592 <p>Curiously, the natural basis of this simple

25594 is here made to furnish a simile for the very

25642 the Sun-god.--Respecting Sūrya, see Kaegi,
25643 p. 54(76). The hymn is rubricated at 106^3^.
25644 It is still used in India, at the Midday Ser-
25645 vice. It was made the text of a linguistic-
25646 mythological comment of 225 pages by W.
25647 Sonne, KZ. vol's xii.-xv. !</p>
25648 <p>In the textus receptus, the hymn has 13
25649 stanzas. I have given only 1-9. In the
25650 first strophe, stanzas 1-3, the god is men-
25651 tioned only in the 3d person. In the second
25652 strophe, he is addressed in the 2d person;
25653 and so also in the third strophe, excepting
25654 --as often--the final stanza (9).</p>
25655 <p>--That stanzas 10-13 are later additions is
25656 proved by their contents and language and
25657 their (differing) metre. This proof is con-
25658 firmed by the fact that the corresponding
25659 passage of the AV., xiii. 2. 16-24, has only
25660 stanzas 1-9; and also by the fact that only
25661 1-9 are prescribed to be used in the ritual--
25662 see Bezzenberger's {%Beiträge,%} viii. 198, ZDMG.

25668 although ‘All-possessor’ was very likely the

25826 <p>STANZAS 1-2. The poet inquires whither
[Page364-b+ 50]
25827 the Maruts are going and how they are to
25828 be detained at the sacrifice. The implicit
25829 answer is ‘With praise.’ This then is accom-
25830 plished in the dialogue, where, although
25831 greatest glory is given to Indra, the god in
25832 turn lauds them generously.</p>
25833 <p>STANZAS 3-4. The Maruts ask why Indra
25834 is going alone, without them, his usual com-
25835 panions. --Indra answers evasively that he
25836 is on the way to a sacrificial feast.</p>
25837 <p>STANZAS 5-6. The Maruts are eager to
25838 go with him. --He retorts that they were
25839 not so eager when he went, alone, and slew
25840 the dragon.</p>
25841 <p>STANZAS 7-8. The Maruts remind him
25842 that they {%have%} helped him do great things
25843 and {%can%} be most useful allies in the future.

26013 This entire final stanza recurs at the end of

26015 ‘refreshment’ leads Roth to suspect that the
26016 original pāda {%d%} of the stanza is lost and
26017 replaced by the one in the text, which is a
26018 stock-verse recurring at the very end of
26019 twenty subsequent hymns.</p>
26020 <p>SELECTION XXXVI. RV. iii. 62. To
26021 Savitar.--Respecting Savitar, see Kaegi, p.
26022 56(79). The last “hymn” (62) of the third
26023 {@maṇḍala@} is really a collection of six short
26024 hymns to various divinities. Each hymn
[Page366-b+ 50]
26025 contains three stanzas, and the triad to
26026 Savitar is the fourth of the six.</p>
26027 <p>--The first stanza of this triad is the most
26028 celebrated stanza of the RV., and is called
26029 the {@sāvitrī́@} (sc. {@ṛ́k@}), or the {@gāyatrī́@} <gr></gr>
26030 <gr></gr>. It has held, and holds even now,
26031 the most important place in the worship of
26032 the Hindus. In the Proceedings of the
26033 {%International Congress of Orientalists%} (1881)
26034 {%at Berlin,%} ii. 2. 160-187, and in {%Religious%}
26035 {%Thought and Life in India,%} p. 399f, Monier-
26036 Williams discusses the place of the RV. in
26037 the religious services of the Hindus of the
26038 present day.</p>
26039 <p>He says that the worshipper must first
26040 bathe, then apply ashes to his limbs and
26041 forehead, bind his hair, sip pure water, and
26042 inhale pure air and retain it in his lungs for
26043 a while. The worshipper then utters RV.
26044 iii. 62. 10, which--like the Lord's Prayer
26045 among Christians and like the Fātihah
26046 among Muhammadans--takes precedence
26047 of all other forms of supplication. [Cf.
26048 Manu ii. 101f.] Later on, the {@gāyatrī@} is
26049 muttered 108 times with the help of a rosary
26050 of Tulsī wood.</p>
26051 <p>--Much has been fabled about the stanza
26052 and its virtues. See, for example, Manu
26053 ii. 77-83. And it recurs frequently in the
26054 other Vedas; thus, four times in the VS.,
26055 twice in the TS., and once in the SV. “No
26056 good and sufficient explanation of the pe-
26057 culiar sanctity attaching to this verse has
26058 ever been given.”--Whitney, reprinted in
26059 Kaegi, N. 222. The stanza has naturally been
26060 imitated a great deal: so even in the RV.
26061 (v. 82) we find verses run in the same mould.
26062 And it is interesting to find the RV. stanzas
26063 iii. 62. 10 ({@gāyatrī@}) and v. 82. 1 repeated in
26064 juxtaposition in the Taittirīya {@āraṇyaka@} at
26065 i. 11. 2 and i. 11. 3. After the pattern of the
26066 {@gāyatrī@} have been made a good many wooden

26076 <p>SELECTION XXXVII. RV. iv. 42. Indra
26077 contests the supremacy of Varuṇa.--Re-
26078 specting Varuṇa, see Hillebrandt, {%Varuṇa%}
26079 {%und Mitra,%} 1877, and Kaegi, p. 61 (85), notes
26080 241f. This hymn has ten stanzas; but the
26081 last three have nothing to do with the rest.</p>
26082 <p>--Varuṇa is by far the noblest and loftiest
26083 character of the Vedic pantheon, and seems
26084 to have held the most prominent position in
26085 the earliest period. Later--as appears if
26086 we consider the RV. as a whole--the war-
26087 like and national god Indra is plainly most
26088 prominent. The gradual supersession of
26089 Varuṇa by Indra^1^ is reflected in a consider-
26090 able number of passages--among them, this
26091 hymn--and especially in x. 124.</p>
26092 <p>--In stanzas 1-4 of this hymn, Varuṇa
26093 claims the godhead, supreme and from the
26094 beginning, in virtue of his creating and sus-
26095 taining the world.--Indra responds (5-6)
26096 by asserting his irresistible might as god
26097 of battle.--And the hymn ends with an
26098 acknowledgment on the part of the poet
26099 (st. 7) of the claims of Indra. This is essen-
26100 tially the interpretation of most of the
26101 authorities.^2^</p>
26102 <p>--But the general drift of the hymn has
26103 been--no less than its details--the subject
26104 of very much discussion and difference of
26105 opinion. Bergaigne^3^ considers stanzas 1-6
26106 as a monologue of Indra. Barth^4^ rejects
26107 the theory of the decadence of the Varuṇa-
26108 cultus and regards RV. x. 124 as one of the
26109 few survivals of a class of myths in which
26110 Varuṇa is not the god of a smiling and
26111 gracious heaven, but a malignant divinity.
26112 Finally, Whitney urges that this is not a
26113 question of supremacy and subordination,
26114 but rather of comparative prominence.--
26115 This selection, I confess, is out of place in
26116 a Reader.</p>

26237 --The stanzas are {@dvipada,@} i. e. consist of
26238 two pādas, one of 8 and one of 11 or 12
26239 syllables. Most nearly like this hymn in

26241 viii. 12, 13, 15, and 18 are essentially similar
26242 (8 + 8 + 12).</p>
26243 <p>--It is very worthy of note that three of
26244 the stanzas occur in immediate juxtaposition
26245 in the other {@saṃhitās,@} and as follows: in
26246 the order 1, 2, 4, at SV. ii. 457, 458, 459, at

26248 (here stanza 3 follows as 26^b^); and in the
26249 order 1, 4, 2 at TS. i. 5. 6 and iv. 4. 4. Finally,
26250 to judge from the legend given below, and
26251 from the prescriptions of the ritual--of the
26252 sacrifice to the Manes, for example--this
26253 hymn would appear to be a {@tṛca@} or triad of
26254 riks (see Sāyaṇa to RV. v. 24 and to PB.
26255 xiii. 12. 5).</p>
26256 <p>--Tradition (Kātyāyana) ascribes this
26257 hymn and also x. 57-60 to the Gaupāyana
26258 brothers, Bandhu, Subandhu, Śrutabandhu,
26259 and Viprabandhu. In his comments to x.
26260 57-60, Sāyaṇa gives the pertinent legendary
26261 material taken from ancient sources; and
26262 this, with other matter, is given in transla-
26263 tion, in JRAS. NS. ii. 441f, by Max Müller,
26264 who discusses the legend at length.</p>
26265 <p>--The Bṛhaddevatā says that king Asa-
26266 māti sent away the four brothers who were
26267 his priests, and put in their stead two Brah-
26268 man wizards. These took shape as doves,
26269 bewitched Subandhu, and plucked out his
26270 soul. In order to cause the spirit to return,

26271 the {%three%} remaining brothers recited x. 58 etc.,
26272 and ‘praised Agni with the {@dvipada@} hymn
26273 as it is among the Atris,’ i. e. in the book of
26274 the family of Atri, the fifth. Then Agni
26275 gave back to Subandhu his soul, and the
26276 brothers, delighted, sang the rest of x. 60

26294 For a critical analysis of the hymn, see
26295 Grassmann, Translation, i. 190 and esp. 540.
26296 Stanzas 6, 7, 8, here given, are quite inde-
26297 pendent of the rest.</p>
26298 <p>--Ludwig identifies the eclipse here re-
26299 ferred to with that of April 20, 1001 B. C.,
26300 O. S.--see {%Sitzungsberichte d. böhmischen%}
26301 {%Gesell. d. Wiss.,%} 1885. His argument is
26302 reported by Whitney, JAOS. xiii. p. lxi f =
26303 PAOS. Oct. 1885, and by Bergaigne, JA.
26304 8. vi. 372f. No fair interpretation of the text
26305 furnishes data precise enough for an exact
26306 identification.</p>
26307 <p>--Stanzas 6 and 8 are spoken by the poet;
26308 stanza 7, by the Sun. The Sun's foe, Súar-
26309 bhānu (accent !), is ‘he who has the sun's
26310 beams,’ and is later identified with Rāhu,
26311 the demon who ‘swallows,’ ‘devours,’ or
26312 ‘seizes’ ({@√2gṛ, √gras@}--cf. 23^1^N., {@√grah@}) the
26313 sun or moon, and so causes eclipses. The
26314 Sun is in terror, and implores Atri for help:
26315 and the latter rescues the orb by prayer and
26316 praise.</p>
26317 <p>--Atri's mythical exploit is often men-
26318 tioned in the Brāhmaṇas (see texts in Lud-
[Page369-b+ 49]
26319 wig, v. 508; and cf. SBE. xxvi. 346). Thus
26320 the PB., at vi. 6. 8, 11, narrates how, at the
26321 request of the gods, Atri restored to bright-
26322 ness the sun, which the demon had smitten
26323 with darkness. On this account, it continues,
26324 a present of gold, the symbol of brightness,
26325 is made to a descendant of Atri at a sacrifice
26326 now-a-days.</p>
26327 <p>--Interesting are the Greek ideas about
26328 the <gr></gr> that bringeth to nought
26329 men's strength and wisdom--see Pindar's
26330 {%Fragments%} [74], Bergk^4^ i. 411f and notes.</p>

26334 ‘The sun, hidden…, Atri found ({@avindat@})
26335 by the fourth prayer.’</p>
26336 <p>--Ludwig reasons thus: The other priests
26337 had a regular liturgy of three prayers for
26338 combating eclipses. On this occasion, these
26339 proved ineffectual. Atri knew a fourth, and
26340 that brought the sun out. Hence the totality
26341 must have been very long. This matter is
26342 discussed in full by Whitney, l. c., p. lxv (= xxi).
26343 Bergaigne, l. c., p. 383 (= 14), says it is a
26344 mere case of the use of a sacred number

26369 <p>SELECTION XLI. RV. vii. 55. Magic
26370 spells to produce sleep.--Ascribed to Vas-
26371 iṣṭha. The hymn consists of three parts
26372 differing in metre and disconnected in con-
26373 tents. For a general discussion of it, see
26374 Colebrooke's {%Essays%} ^2^i. 27, and Whitney's
26375 note, ibid. p. 112; JAOS. iii. 336f; and esp.
26376 Aufrecht, ISt. iv. 337f. Sāyaṇa reports the
26377 native traditions about the hymn. Thus:</p>
26378 <p>Vasiṣṭha came by night to the house of
26379 Varuṇa--to sleep, say some; to steal grain,
26380 say others. He was assailed by the watch-
26381 dog, which bayed at him, and fain would
26382 have bitten him; but he laid the hound
26383 asleep with the stanza beginning,
26384 When, silv'ry Sārameya, thou,
26385 and the one following.--Later superstition
26386 uses the hymn to quiet uncanny creatures
26387 at night: see Rigvidhāna, ii. 26.</p>
26388 <p>--FIRST PART. The hymn next preceding
26389 this in the RV., vii. 54, is to Vāstoṣpati, the
26390 Lar familiaris, and consists of three stanzas.
26391 The first part of our hymn, vii. 55. 1, is a mere
26392 addition to these three stanzas, and belongs
26393 accordingly to vii. 54 rather than to vii. 55,
26394 as appears from the fact that the four
26395 stanzas are all recited together in the cere-
26396 mony of moving into a new house. See
26397 ŚGS. iii. 4, AGS. ii. 9. 9, and esp. PGS. iii. 4. 7
26398 --all in SBE. xxix.; and cf. MS. i. 5. 13.</p>
26399 <p>The joining of this stanza to hymn 55 is a
26400 simple misdivision of which the NT. shows
26401 many parallel instances. Thus Mark ix. 1
26402 belongs to viii.; chap. ix. should begin with
26403 the Transfiguration. A converse misdivision
26404 is at AV. vi. 63-64 as compared with RV.
26405 x. 191.</p>
26406 <p>--SECOND PART. Stanzas 2-4 are part of
26407 a scene at the entrance to Yama's kingdom
26408 or the regions of the blessed. Yama's two
26409 watch-dogs (cf. 83^17^N. and introd.) guard the
26410 pathway and keep out the wicked. Here
26411 one of them barks at some who would come
26412 in; and these, in turn, protest that they
26413 are godly men, and so have a right to
26414 enter in peace. See Kaegi, N. 274; Zimmer,
26415 p. 421.</p>
[Page370-b+ 50]
26416 <p>--THIRD PART. Stanzas 5-8 are the in-
26417 cantations by which the entire household is
26418 put to sleep. According to Aufrecht, l. c.
26419 (or Zimmer, p. 308), it is while a maid is
26420 receiving the visit of her lover; but that
26421 seems a little doubtful because we have
26422 plurals {@nas@} and {@sáṃ hanmas@} and {@vayám,@}
26423 lines 12, 13, 15, and not duals.</p>
26424 <p>With stanzas 5, 6, 7, 8 correspond respec-
26425 tively stanzas 6, 5, 1, 3 of AV. iv. 5, and the
26426 variants are interesting. The third part has
26427 nothing to do with the second; but the dia-
26428 skeuasts have juxtaposed them because in
26429 both a dog is put to sleep.</p>

26480 Maruts or gods of the storm-winds.--Com-
26481 pare selection xxxv. (73^4^) and introduction.
26482 The hymn consists of two parts, of which
26483 the first, here given, ends with stanza 10.
26484 Number 11 is only the fragment of a stanza.
26485 The rest (12-25) is in an entirely different
26486 metre.</p>
26487 <p>--The metre of the ten stanzas is without
26488 doubt a secondary one, being simply a form
26489 of the {@triṣṭubh@} syncopated at the sixth place,
26490 i. e. with the prevailingly light sixth syllable
26491 left out (cf. JAOS. xi. p. lxiii = PAOS. May,
26492 1881). Thus,
26493 <gr></gr>.
26494 Each of the parts into which the verse is
26495 broken is a ‘syllable-pentad’ or {@akṣara-@}
26496 {@paṅkti;@} and each is an independent {@pāda,@}
26497 since verbs at the beginning of the even
26498 pentads are accented, e. g., at vii. 34. 3^b^, 3^d^, 4^b^,
26499 6^b^. A pentad-couplet is sometimes joined
26500 with a simply broken but unsyncopated
26501 {@triṣṭubh@} verse to form a half-stanza or
26502 stanza (e. g. i. 67. 8^cd^; 70. 4^cd^, 10^cd^; x. 46. 1^gh^);
26503 and this fact seems to suggest the derivative
26504 character of the pentads.</p>
26505 <p>--The {@gāyatrī@}-stanza has 3 verses of 8
26506 syllables; and the strophe has 3 stanzas, a

26884 didst cause to fly asunder, when thou wast
26885 conquering all thy foes.’ It appears to me
26886 likely that the natural phenomenon to which
26887 this refers is a water-spout (‘Trombe’) on
26888 an inland lake. This fear-inspiring thing
26889 may well be personified as a demon. The
26890 verb {@úd avartayas@} means ‘didst cause to
26891 move out or fly asunder with a gyratory or
26892 centrifugal motion.’ This accords well with
26893 the facts of the not infrequent phenomenon
26894 as seen by unscientific eyes. See Major
26895 Sherwill on Bengal waterspouts, JASB. 1860,
26896 xxix. 366f, with good pictures, and Th. Reye,
26897 {%Die Wirbelstürme%}^2^, p. 17f. The line MBh.
26898 v. 10. 37 = 328 seems to favor my view. The
26899 whole passage is a reminiscence of the
26900 Namuci-myth.</p>
26901 <p>The head of the column is twisted and
26902 made to burst asunder and scatter itself
26903 ({@phénena,@} instr. of accompaniment, lit. ‘with
26904 foam,’ i. e.) in abundant foamy masses. Then,
26905 with the dispersion of the column, often
[Page375-b+ 49]
26906 comes (Sherwill, 370; Reye, 32) a heavy
26907 rain. All this is set forth as gracious Indra's
26908 prowess. --U. f. {@ájayas spṛ́dhas,@} see 74^12^N.</p>

26911 <p>--The form of the myth as it appears in

26913 of the case-relation of {@phénena@} (see above),
26914 which they take as an instr. of means, i. e.

26972 (16-22), after rejection of one stanza, forms
26973 two strophes: 16, 17, 18 may be safely grouped

26975 followed Grassmann in rejecting st. 21, on
26976 account of the contents and language. More-
26977 over, the tense of {@īdhe@} is proper to a final

27085 <p>--Although {@maṇḍala@} x. on the whole is
27086 late, it yet contains antique passages; and
27087 among these the following seems to belong:
27088 so Roth. The hymn contains 16 stanzas, of
27089 which 13-16 are palpably later additions.
27090 Only 7-12 are actually prescribed by Āśva-
27091 lāyana for use in the funeral service; but 1
27092 and 2, although not rubricated, are given
27093 for their intrinsic interest.</p>
27094 <p>--The passage as it stands consists of an
27095 introductory summons to the assembled
27096 mourners (1-2); and of an address to the
27097 departed (7-8); then, after bidding the
27098 mourners disperse (stanza 9), the spokesman
27099 implores the favor of the kindly-disposed
27100 hounds of Yama, for the departed (11) and
27101 for the company (12).</p>
[Page377-b+ 49]
27102 <p>--In stanza 10, on the other hand, these
27103 hounds are conceived as ill-disposed crea-
27104 tures standing guard to keep the departed
27105 out of bliss--see p. 370; and possibly the
27106 stanza which originally belonged with 9 has
27107 been displaced by the one in our text. Or
27108 is stanza 9 itself the intruder ? see Bezzen-
27109 berger's {%Beiträge,%} viii. 202.</p>

27234 used at the ceremony of cremation.--Rubri-
27235 cated are only stanzas 1-9 and 14--see p.
27236 402. The rubricated stanzas are translated
27237 by Max Müller, ZDMG. ix. p. viiif, and the
27238 whole hymn by Zimmer, p. 402. Most of
27239 the stanzas are addressed to Agni; but 3, 6,
27240 and 7, to the dead man. The hymn has two
27241 parts, clearly sundered by the metre.</p>
27242 <p>--In the first, Agni is to burn the corpse,
27243 not rudely, but gently, just enough to “make
27244 it done.” To this end, a sacrificial goat
27245 (st. 4) is provided, and (st. 7) the corpse is
27246 covered with a caul, in order that Agni may
27247 spend his fury on these things and spare the
[Page379-a+ 50]
27248 corpse from too severe a burning. The
27249 original purpose of this custom may have
27250 been different. The Greeks had the custom
27251 --see Il. xxiii. 165f, Od. xxiv. 65f.</p>
27252 <p>Moreover, Agni is to carry up the departed
27253 to the Fathers or Manes, who have their seat
27254 in the ‘fore-heaven’ (AV. xviii. 2. 48, Whit-
27255 ney, OLSt. i. 59). Perhaps st. 8-10 did not
27256 belong originally to the first part.</p>
27257 <p>--The second part consists of heterogene-
27258 ous material, vagrant stanzas, having some
27259 connection, verbal or logical, real or apparent,
27260 with the words or ideas of the first.</p>
27261 <p>--Every stanza of the hymn, save st. 11,
27262 appears in the AV., and some elsewhere also,
27263 and with interesting variants.</p>

27284 microcosm. Each element in him comes

27497 “Tvaṣṭar's making a wedding for his daughter”--
27498 At this news all the world here comes together.
27499 Yama's mother, during her wedding,
27500 The wife of mighty Vivasvant, vanished.
27501 They hid away the immortal from mortals.
27502 Making a like one, they gave her to Vivasvant.
27503 And she bare the two Aśvins when that happened,
27504 And left two pairs behind her--Saraṇyū.</p>
27505 <p>--“A braw story, but unco short.” The
27506 actual text is tantalizingly fragmentary. We
27507 can hardly hope to recover the legend with
27508 any satisfactory completeness. Yāska gives
27509 it thus:</p>
27510 <p>Tvaṣṭar's daughter, Saraṇyū, bare twins
27511 (Yama and Yamī) to Vivasvant. She foisted
27512 upon him another female of the same appear-
27513 ance ({@sávarṇām@}), and, taking on the form
27514 of a mare, fied forth. Vivasvant took on
27515 the form of a horse, followed her, and
27516 coupled with her. From that were born the
27517 two Aśvins or ‘Horse-men.’ Of the {@sávarṇā@}
27518 was born Manu.</p>
27519 <p>That is--Vivasvant, the Sun, and Saraṇyā,
27520 were the parents of Yama and Yamī (83^8^,
27521 92^14^), the first human pair. But there was
27522 a coexisting belief in Manu (see {@manu@} in
27523 vocab., and cf. SBE. xxv. p. lvii) as the father
27524 of mankind. Are not RV. x. 17. 1-2 the frag-
27525 ment of a legend which attempted to recon-
27526 cile the two beliefs by fabling a {@sávarṇā@}
27527 who should give birth to Manu, so that,
27528 according to either myth, the human race
27529 are the Children of the Sun ?</p>

27579 those of the later ritual. For illustrations
27580 of these differences, see Roth, ZDMG. viii.
27581 471f. The hymn is given, with the concord-
27582 ants and variants of the AV., TB., TA., and

27584 dhara to the concordant passages, by Win-

27596 give “the action” of the hymn.</p>
[Page382-b+ 50]
27597 <p>--The hymn is remarkable for its intrinsic
27598 interest and beauty. And it has acquired
27599 great notoriety in connection with the dis-
27600 cussions of Suttee ({@= satī@}) or Hindu widow-
27601 burning. Properly, {@satī@} (see {@sant 4@}) means
27602 a ‘virtuous wife.’ Improperly, but more
27603 commonly, it has come to be used of the
27604 rite of self-immolation which she practised.
27605 See the admirable article {%Suttee%} in Col. H.
27606 Yule's {%Anglo-Indian Glossary,%} with some forty
27607 pertinent extracts.</p>
27608 <p>--That Suttee is an ancient custom appears
27609 from many references to it in classical au-
27610 thors. See Cicero, {%Tusc. disp.%} v. 27. 78; Pro-
27611 pertius, iv. 12. 15; Plutarch, {%Moralia,%} p. 499;
27612 Nicholas of Damascus, fr. 143 = frag. hist.
27613 graec., ed. Müller, iii. 463; Strabo, xv. 30, p.
27614 699; 62, p. 714; and esp. the story in Diodo-
27615 rus Siculus, xix. 33-34, according to which
27616 the rite is authenticated for 316 B. C. These
27617 passages are given in full by J. Grimm, in
27618 his masterly essay, {%Ueber das Verbrennen der%}
27619 {%Leichen, Abh. der Berliner Akad.,%} 1849, p. 261f
27620 {%= Kleinere Schriften,%} ii. 298f. And Peter von
27621 Bohlen, in {%Das alte Indien%} (1830), i. 293-302,
27622 cites a great deal of interesting pertinent
27623 literature.</p>
27624 <p>--The custom was abolished by the British
27625 during the administration of Lord William
27626 Bentinck, in 1829. The story of the aboli-
27627 tion is well told by H. H. Wilson, in his con-
27628 tinuation of James Mill's {%History of British%}
27629 {%India,%} vol. iii. (= ix.), 185-192. For descrip-
27630 tions, statistics, etc., see Parliamentary Doc's
27631 1821. xviii.; 1823. xvii.; 1824. xxiii.; 1825. xxiv.;

27637 <p>--From Müller's {%Essay on Comparative%}
27638 {%Mythology, Chips,%} ii. 34f, or {%Selected Essays,%}
27639 vol. i. (ed. of 1881), p. 333f, it would appear
27640 that the seventh stanza of our hymn had
27641 played a great rôle in Hindu history. At
27642 any rate, this idea is current, and seems
27643 traceable to the {%Essay.%} Here it is stated
27644 that the stanza was purposely falsified by an
27645 unscrupulous priesthood, and that a garbled
27646 version of it, reading {@agnéḥ@} for {@ágre,@} was
[Page383-a+ 50]
27647 directly responsible for the sacrifice of thou-
27648 sands of innocent lives. That the author is
27649 in error on these points is argued with great
27650 detail by Fitzedward Hall, JRAS. NS. iii. 183-
27651 192. He shows that the misreading can be
27652 traced to Raghunandana, ca. 1500 A. D., and
27653 no further; and that Suttee was deemed to be
27654 amply justified by warrants other than those
27655 of the Vedic {@saṃhitā,@} which was by no
27656 means the ultimate appeal for the mediæval
27657 Hindu.</p>
27658 <p>--In the literary discussions of Suttee, on
27659 the other hand, the stanza has indeed played
27660 a rôle. There is probably no other stanza
27661 in the Veda about which so much has been
27662 written. It was first cited, in mangled form
27663 and as sanction for Suttee, by Colebrooke,
27664 in 1794, {%On the duties of a faithful Hindu%}
27665 {%widow, Asiatick Researches,%} 1795, iv. 209-219
27666 {%= Essays,%} i. 133-140. It was discussed by
27667 Wilson, in 1854, in his paper {%On the supposed%}
27668 {%Vaidik authority%} for Suttee, JRAS. xvi. 201-
27669 14 {%= Works,%} ii. 270-92. In answer to this,
27670 Rājā Rādhākānta Deva, in 1858, endeavored
27671 to adduce good Vedic authority for the rite,
27672 JRAS. xvii. 209-17 (reprinted in Wilson's
27673 {%Works,%} ii. 293-305). The most exhaustive
27674 treatment of the various readings of the
27675 stanza is that by Hall, l. c. Finally must
27676 be mentioned the paper read by Rājendralāla
27677 Mitra in 1870, {%On the funeral ceremonies%} etc.,
27678 JASB. xxxix. 1. 241-264 (reprinted in his In-
27679 troduction to the TA., p. 33-58, and with
27680 additions in his {%Indo-Aryans,%} ii. 114-155); see
27681 esp. p. 257f (= 50f = 147f).</p>
27682 <p>--The Rigveda gives no warrant for the
27683 custom. Śaunaka, in the Bṛhad-devatā,
27684 furnishes important positive evidence against
27685 it (see {%Chips,%} ii. 37); and likewise Manu, v.
27686 156-8 (= 64^10^f, see N.). Cf. Kaegi, N. 51.</p>
27687 <p>--The hymn was originally used at a
27688 burial which was not preceded by cremation.
27689 The situation and action are as follows. The
27690 corpse lies on a raised place; and by it is
27691 the widow.</p>
27692 <p>STANZAS 1-2. The spokesman adjures
27693 Death to remove, and to harm not the
27694 living (1); and pronounces for them absolu-
27695 tion from impurity (2).</p>
27696 <p>STANZAS 3-4. The conductor of the cere-
[Page383-b+ 50]
27697 mony dwells with joy on the fact that,
27698 thanks to the efficacy of their prayers, they
27699 have not joined the company of the dead (3).
27700 Now, for the better safety of the survivors,
27701 and wishing them long life, he sets a stone
27702 near the grave as a symbolic boundary of
27703 the domain of Death, as a barrier, so that
27704 he may not pass to the space beyond or
27705 domain of the living.</p>
27706 <p>STANZAS 5-6. The wish and prayer for
27707 long life is here continued.</p>
27708 <p>STANZAS 7-8. The women are now sum-
27709 moned to make their appearance together,
27710 and, provided with ointments, ‘to go up to
27711 the place,’ i. e. of course, where the dead
27712 man and the widow are (7).</p>
27713 <p>Here we must infer that they adorn the
27714 widow (as a sign that she is to re-enter the
27715 world of life), and that the dead man's
27716 brother ({@devṛ́,@} ‘levir’) then takes her hand
27717 in token of the levirate marriage.</p>
27718 <p>The priest then bids her leave her lifeless
27719 spouse, and makes solemn declaration of the
27720 new relation into which she has entered (8).</p>
27721 <p>STANZA 9. The bow is now taken from
27722 the dead man's hand, in order that the power
27723 and glory of which the weapon was the
27724 symbol may remain with the survivors; and
27725 a closing benediction is said for them and
27726 for the departed.</p>
27727 <p>STANZAS 10-13. “And now, with gentle
27728 action and tender words, the body is com-
27729 mitted to the earth.”</p>

27771 think of ‘hundred’ as just ‘99 + 1.’ --See

27773 ment of the mg. ‘May they hide Death by

27777 <p>--There is much evidence that the age of
27778 a hundred years was deemed entirely normal.
27779 This appears from RV. i. 89. 9. Again, to a
27780 question about a funeral lustration, Pāras-
27781 kara (PGS. iii. 10. 14, 15) prescribes the use of
27782 a special answer “in case the departed was
27783 not yet a hundred years old.” Weber, ISt.

27786 Jātaka (Fausböll, vol. ii. p. 16), the Bodhisat
27787 says to his father, when the latter sneezes,
27788 O Gagga, live a hundred years,
27789 And twenty others added on.…

27797 <p>--Very interesting are the classical stories
27798 of Hindu longevity. Sometimes, according
27799 to Onesikritos, they capped a hundred with
27800 thirty more--Strabo, xv. 34, p. 701. The Uttara
27801 Kurus are said, MBh. vi. 7. 11 = 264, to live
27802 1000 or 10,000 years, and to this fable is prob-

27847 entered into the state of being wife of a

27850 <p>--Hillebrandt, at ZDMG. xl. 708f, shows
27851 plainly that this stanza, RV. x. 18. 8, belonged
27852 originally to the ritual of the human sacri-
27853 fice. Weber describes the ceremony at
27854 ZDMG. xviii. 269f = {%Indische Streifen,%} i. 65f.
27855 The king's first queen was obliged to lie
27856 with the dead victim. The situation is evi-
27857 dent from the connection in which RV. x.
27858 18. 8 occurs at AV. xviii. 3. 1-4. She is bidden
27859 to rise with our stanza, {@úd īrṣva nāri@}--see
27860 Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta-sūtra, xvi. 13. 13.</p>
27861 <p>In this light, the logical connection of
27862 pādas {%a b%} with pādas {%c d%} becomes clear. She
27863 is to forsake the corpse and “come hither”
27864 to the king.
27865 Rise up, woman, to the world of the living.
27866 Fled is the soul of him with whom thou liest. Come hither.
27867 Quitting the embrace of hateful Death, the
27868 queen rises and approaches him who had
27869 already once taken her hand in wedlock and
27870 now stands waiting for her as a suitor once
27871 more. Upon thus resuming her proper rela-
27872 tion of wife again, she is greeted with the
27873 words:
27874 To him who grasped thy hand, thy suitor now,
27875 As wife to husband art thou become related.</p>
27876 <p>--As appears from AGS. iv. 2. 18 = 102^7^,
27877 this stanza was at an early date appropriated
27878 for the funeral-service, where--as an accom-
27879 paniment of the levirate marriage--it fits
27880 very well ({@didhiṣú@} means also ‘a second
27881 husband’). Regarding leviration, see Kaegi,
27882 N. 51. Its existence in Vedic times is proved
27883 by RV. x. 40. 2.--Compare also Deuteronomy

27932 to ashes, dust to dust” of Christian burial),
27933 and to betray the natural “uncanny feeling

27957 <p>--The stanza is fully discussed, JAOS. xi.
27958 p. cxci = PAOS. May, 1884. It is interesting
27959 as illustrating the varieties of cumulative
27960 evidence that may be brought to bear on
27961 the criticism of the Veda. Thus: 1. The
27962 stanza is at the end of the hymn and out of
27963 connection. 2. It is in a different kind of
27964 metre. 3. The metre is bad of its kind.
27965 4. The form {@íṣvās@} is bad Vedic--for {@íṣos;@}
27966 and 5. {@pratī́cīm@} is a late form for {@pratīcī́m.@}
27967 6. The stanza is ignored by Āśvalāyana;
27968 and 7. by Sāyaṇa.</p>
27969 <p>SELECTION LIV. RV. x. 33. 4-9. The
27970 aged priest to the young prince.--The hymn
27971 has nine stanzas. The first three have nothing
27972 to do with the rest. The rest (4-9) forms
27973 two {@tṛca's.@} This passage has more than
27974 common freshness, and also directness of
27975 connection with the life of Vedic time. The
27976 situation would seem to be somewhat as
27977 follows.</p>
27978 <p>--The old priest stood well with the gods,
27979 so that the efficacy of his intercession with
27980 them was of unusually good repute. Accord-
27981 ingly, the foes of king Kuruśravaṇa had
27982 once tried to win the Rishi over to their side
27983 and away from his master, Kuruśravaṇa;
27984 but in vain. He had remained faithful to
27985 the royal family in whose service he long
27986 had been.</p>
27987 <p>Now at last king Kuruśravaṇa has passed
27988 away, leaving Upamaśravas as his son and
27989 heir. And in presence of the young prince,
27990 the priest tells with pride and pleasure of
27991 the old times, and speaks with regret of the
27992 loss of his departed patron.</p>
27993 <p>--Ludwig, iii. 182, has called attention to
27994 the genealogical series of the RV. These
27995 cover oftenest, of course, only three genera-
[Page386-b+ 53]
27996 tions, since memory, unaided by records,
27997 does not easily go further back. But for
27998 preserving that amount of genealogical tra-
27999 dition there was frequent need (Weber, ISt.
28000 x. 78-88, esp. 82): thus, at the offering to
28001 the Manes, the priest has to address by name
28002 the father, grandfather, and great-grand-
28003 father of the sacrificer; see ŚB. ii. 4. 2^16^ or
28004 SBE. xii. 365 or OLSt. i. 60: similarly at
28005 the {@pravara;@} cf. ISt. ix. 322-3 or x. 78-9 or
28006 Müller, ASL. 386.</p>
28007 <p>In the present instance, however, we have
28008 a series of five at least. Trasadasyu is a
28009 prince of the Pūru tribe, and of the {%line%} of
28010 Purukutsa (he is not necessarily the latter's
28011 son--RV. vii. 19. 3), and is often mentioned
28012 for his generosity and for the special favors
28013 shown him by the gods. The series is

28050 [? The text is awkward and unclear.] Time

28185 burial stanzas at 105^9^ and 105^18^. The eighth
28186 is also used (100^11^) as a wedding-stanza, in

28188 on her wedding-journey. See also AB. iii.

28209 <p>--STANZA 6 is really a prayer to Agni and
28210 his flames to help in the work of devotion.
28211 As the immortal messenger (see Muir, v. 201)
28212 between men and gods, he is to go from
28213 earth, traverse the atmosphere (see {@rájas@} in
28214 vocab.), and pursue his way to the gods
28215 through the {@súar.@} Here he is to keep to
28216 the paths (cf. TS. v. 7. 7) which are made by
28217 the prayers and oblations that go up to the
28218 gods,--the {@devayānās@} or ‘god-paths,’ as
28219 the AB. at iii. 38 calls them, on which the
28220 gods descend to man. Pāda {%c,%} continuing
28221 the metaphor of {%a,%} is addressed to Agni's
28222 flames; and {%d,%} to Agni.

28241 <p>--STANZA 8. The situation is perhaps
28242 this. A band of men, hotly pursued by their
28243 enemies, are in the middle of a stream, which
28244 they hope soon to have put betwixt them-
28245 selves and the foe. They call out to each
[Page389-a+ 59]
28246 other encouragingly the words of the stanza.
28247 The famous hymn RV. iii. 33 involves a situ-
28248 ation which is similar (Muir, i^2^. 338), and,
28249 indeed, familiar elsewhere (Hebrews xi. 29;
28250 Hdt. viii. 138).
28251 The stream is stony. Hold ye well together.
28252 Your footing keep. On ! make your crossing, comrades !
28253 There let us leave them in a mood unhappy,
28254 While we go out and on to happy conquests.</p>
28255 <p>SELECTION LVIII. RV. x. 85. 36, 24-26,
28256 32-33, 27, 43-47. The wedding-hymn.--The
28257 stanzas are here given in the order in which
28258 they are rubricated at 98^19^f--see p. 398.
28259 Their uses in the ritual are discussed by
28260 Haas in his treatise on the ancient wedding
28261 customs of India, ISt. v. 267-412.</p>
28262 <p>--The hymn is called the {@sūryā-sūkta@} or
28263 “The marriage of Soma and Sūryā,” and
28264 has received at the hands of Dr. J. Ehni,
28265 ZDMG. xxxiii. 166-176, a mythological inter-
28266 pretation, briefly summarized in AJP. i. 211.
28267 The hymn has 47 stanzas, with an appendix
28268 given by Aufrecht, {%Rigveda^2^%} ii. 682, and com-
28269 prises somewhat heterogeneous matter (ISt.
28270 v. 269). Most of the hymn occurs in AV.
28271 xiv. 1 and 2, with many variants. Partial

28288 appendix by Weber, ISt. v. 177-195. This
28289 is followed by one of AV. xiv. (pages 195-
28290 217) and of the other wedding-stanzas of the
28291 AV. (pages 218-266)--see also Ludwig, iii.
28292 p. 469-76. Most of the Reader-stanzas are
28293 translated, with explanations, by Zimmer,

28295 317-325.</p>
28296 <p>STANZA 36. Said to the bride by the
28297 groom in the very act of taking her hand in
28298 token of wedlock.</p>
28299 <p>STANZAS 24-26 and 32-33. Said just be-
28300 fore the bride's departure for her new home.
28301 Stanzas 24 and 32 are said by a third person;
28302 25, 26, and 33 {%may%} be put in the mouth of
28303 the groom. St. 33 may, as the Sūtra says,
[Page389-b+ 50]
28304 be spoken on the way, when people come
28305 out of their dwellings to gaze.</p>
28306 <p>STANZA 27. Pādas {%a, b,%} and {%c%} are said to
28307 the bride, and {%d%} to the couple, on their
28308 arrival.</p>
28309 <p>STANZAS 43-47. The groom first prays
28310 to Prajāpati on behalf of himself and his
28311 bride (43 {%a b%}), and addresses the latter with
28312 good wishes and solemn benedictions (43 {%c d,%}
28313 44); prays to Indra that the bride may be
28314 fruitful (45); bids her hold her own with her
28315 new relatives (46); and, finally, beseeches
28316 the gods, on behalf of himself and his wife,
28317 that they two may dwell in unity (47).</p>
28318 <p>{@5-6. gṛbhṇā́mi…hástam:@} this, the dex-
28319 trarum iunctio, is the essential feature of
28320 the simplest wedding-ritual, see Haas, 277,

28322 (64^10^); the AV. modernizes, reading, {@gṛhṇā́mi.@}
28323 With the concordant stanza of the AV. are
28324 grouped several others (48, 49, 51) of like
28325 import. --‘With me as husband’ (343b).
28326 {@--yáthā_ásas,@} ‘ut sis.’ --U. f. {@máhyam@}
28327 {@tvā_adus@} (829). {@--gā́rh-,@} ‘for (our) being

28332 phrase is equiv. in {%form%} to the older one
28333 (84^11^), but refers here rather to the ‘world
28334 of the pious’ on earth.
28335 I loose thee from Varuṇa's bond,
28336 With which kindly Savitar bound thee.--
28337 At the altar, in the company of the good,
28338 I put thee unharmed with thy husband.</p>
28339 <p>--The first half-stanza is an allegorical,
28340 and the second a literal address to the bride.
28341 In the allegory, the bond of Varuṇa is night
28342 (Hillebrandt). Savitar is the ‘Impeller,’ not
28343 only of the rising, but also of the setting sun
28344 (RV. i. 35. 3^a^). He brings rest (ii. 38. 3, 4) by
28345 sending night, whose gentle bond he lays
28346 (Muir, v. 235-7) upon his daughter, Sūryā,
28347 ‘The Sun,’ till she is released for her bridal
28348 with Soma, ‘The Moon’ (masc.), a union
28349 which is the prototype (cf. Haas, 328) of
28350 human marriages.</p>
28351 <p>From the more literal point of view,
28352 the bond of {@Varuṇa,@} as the upholder of the
28353 established order of things, is (not night--
[Page390-a+ 49]
28354 still less sickness--but) the tie by which a
28355 maid is bound to her father till a man come
28356 to loose and take her.--See the discussions

28501 --saints, warriors, poet-sages,--a descrip-
28502 tion of whom makes up most of the hymn.
28503 In stanzas 4 and 5, {@gacchatāt@} (see 570) is a
28504 3d sing., ‘O Yama, let him go;’ in the rest,
28505 it may be a 2d or a 3d.--Ludwig, ii. 394,

28541 <p>SELECTION LXII. MS. ii. 13. 23. Hiraṇya-

28543 selection lxviii.).--The RV. version (x. 121)
28544 of this famous hymn has been translated by
28545 Max Müller, ASL. 569, and {%Chips,%} i. 29; by
28546 Ludwig, no. 948; and by Muir, with com-
28547 ments, iv^2^. 15-18.</p>
[Page392-a+ 50]
28548 <p>--STRUCTURE of the hymn. The seven
28549 stanzas here given (or perhaps only 2-6)
28550 constitute the original stock of the hymn.
28551 To this is added, in the MS.-version, an
28552 eighth stanza, quite impertinent to the rest;
28553 and in the RV.-version, three stanzas (8, 9,
28554 10), whose character is determinable by
28555 various and interesting criteria.</p>
28556 <p>Pāda {%d%} of each stanza is a refrain, ‘Whom
28557 as god shall we worship with oblation ? i. e.
28558 Who is the god that we are to worship with
28559 oblation ?’ The later Vedic texts under-
28560 stand it, ‘We will worship the god Who or
28561 Ka,’ making of the interrogative pronoun a
28562 deity whom they identify with Prajāpati
28563 (selection lxviii.). The other pādas of stan-
28564 zas 2-6 are relative clauses with {@yás, yásya,@}
28565 {@yéna, yásmin.@} These may refer</p>
28566 <p>{@A.@} To {@devā́ya:@} ‘Who (interrog.) is the
28567 god,--who (relative) became king, etc. etc.,
28568 --that we are to worship ?’ Ludwig: ‘Ka,
28569 the god,--who is become king, etc. etc.,--
28570 we would wait upon with havis.’--Better,
28571 perhaps,</p>
28572 <p>{@B.@} To {@hiraṇyagarbhás,@} although stanza
28573 1 (and 7 as well) looks as if it might have
28574 been an afterthought. This leaves the con-
28575 nection of the refrain with the rest of each
28576 stanza very loose; but this is perhaps just
28577 what it ought to be.</p>
28578 <p>--The hymn corresponds to RV. x. 121.
28579 The comparative study of the differeing ver-
28580 sions of the same traditional material, as it
28581 appears in different Vedic texts, is interest-
28582 ing and instructive; and there is no better
28583 opportunity for it than this (see Preface,
28584 p. v, N. 2).</p>
28585 <p>The hymn occurs also at TS. iv. 1. 8; in the
28586 VS., with the stanzas scattered, at xiii. 4,
28587 xxiii. 3, xxv. 13, xxv. 12, xxxii. 6, 7, xxvii. 25;
28588 and at AV. iv. 2. The TS. version follows
28589 that of the RV. most nearly. Disregarding
28590 the order, the same is true of the VS. The
28591 AV. version looks like an unsuccessful
28592 attempt at writing down a half-remembered
28593 piece.</p>

28665 --Respecting Yama and Yamī, see notes to
28666 85^12^f.</p>
28667 <p>--The prose of the Brāhmaṇas is not difficult. In
28668 reading it, the chief thing is some familiarity with
28669 the style, i. e. ability to divide up the discourse aright
28670 into the little clauses and choppy sentences with
28671 which it proceeds. As a help to this it is important
28672 to observe that the particle {%átha%} marks the beginning
28673 of a new clause, and that the postpositive {%vai%} marks
28674 the foregoing word as the first of its clause. Analo-
28675 gous is the use of {%nāma%} to distinguish a proper name
28676 from an identical appellative. Cf. Pliny, {%Epp.%} vi. 31,
28677 evocatus in consilium ad centum cellas (hoc loco
28678 nomen)….</p>
28679 <p>As my colleague, Professor A. P. Peabody, has
28680 observed in his translations of Cicero's {%Offices%} and
28681 {%Tusculans,%} there are certain connectives and illatives
28682 which are employed as mere catchwords for the eye.
28683 In manuscripts (Greek, Latin, Sanskrit) written with
28684 letters of one size, with no separation of words, and
28685 with very few stops, these particles serve the pur-
28686 pose effected now-a-days by capitals, by division or
28687 spacing, and by punctuation. In spoken language it
28688 is often wrong to render them otherwise than by
28689 inflection or by stress of voice.</p>

29160 lished the text in the {%Abhandlungen für die%}
29161 {%Kunde des Morgenlandes,%} vol. iii., 1864; and
29162 the translation, vol. iv., 1865. Cf. Weber,
29163 {%Indische Streifen,%} ii. 296f. The text appeared
29164 with a Hindu comment in the {%Bibliotheca%}

29167 <p>--On the subject-matter of this selection,
29168 the following essays and books may be con-
29169 sulted. The most important is the essay of
29170 Haas, with additions by Weber, ISt. v. 267-
29171 410; cf. esp. the synoptic index, 410-12.
29172 Haas gives the text and an annotated trans-
29173 lation of our selection at pages 289f, 362f.</p>

29178 <p>--Birth, reproduction, and death are the three
29179 great facts of all organic life. It is therefore natural
29180 that the customs connected with marriage and burial
29181 should take so important a place in the traditions
29182 of primitive peoples. It can hardly be doubted that
29183 a considerable body of these customs have their root
29184 in Indo-European antiquity. For we find, as between
29185 the various members of this family, many and most
29186 striking coincidences of usage. The systematic ex-
29187 position and criticism of these coincidences form one
29188 of the most interesting chapters of comparative phil-
29189 ology. It is not feasible to point them out in detail
29190 here. In lien of this may be cited--</p>

29322 the Hindu mind this lugging in of {@sāma@} has
29323 a charming mystic significance, inasmuch as
29324 {@sā@} plus {@ama@} makes {@sāma@} (see AB. iii. 23;

29354 the four portions “cut off” or separated
29355 from the {@havis@} or sacrificial food. The first
29356 is done by the groom; the rest by the brother.
29357 The descendants of Jamadagni used to “cut
29358 off” five such portions (ISt. v. 366; x. 95)
29359 and so had to strew grain three times.--
29360 Oldenberg's note. {@--eṣas,@} refers back.</p>
29361 <p>--‘(The groom) having poured the sacri-
29362 ficial butter on the bride's hollowed-and-

29364 sentative strews parched grain (on her hands)
29365 twice [Thrice (is the custom) of the Jamad-
29366 agnians.], sprinkling again (sc. {@ājya@}) over
29367 the {@havis@} (= what he has left of the grain in
29368 the basket) and over the {@avatta@} (= what grain
29369 he has strewn on her hands). This (as just
29370 stated) is the cutting-off-usage.’</p>

29377 cf. AGS. iii. 8. 7. The forms are filled out

29379 which, as here, does not always fit the metre.</p>
29380 <p>{@18.@} ‘With the above mantras (uttered
29381 by the groom), she, not-parting (fem.) her
29382 joined-hands, should offer (the grain in
29383 them), as with a {@sruc.@}’ The nose of the
29384 {@sruc@} is at the side. She is therefore to pour
29385 out the grain so,--not over her finger-tips.</p>
29386 <p>--For the case of families who do not
29387 strew grain but twice, we must assume that
29388 the bride, when making her second oblation,
29389 does not offer all the grain in her joined-
29390 hands, but leaves some for her third oblation.
29391 Her fourth is from the basket.</p>

29393 around (on the part of the groom), (the
29394 bride should offer grain) with the nose of
29395 the basket towards herself in silence the
29396 fourth time.’ The “silence” refers of course
[Page400-b+ 53]
29397 to the groom. The bride does not say any-
29398 thing at any time (cf. SBE. xxix. 37).</p>
