Digitization of Lanman Sanskrit Reader

## pdfs
The digitization was made from a scanned image of Lanman's Sanskrit reader.  The pdfs directory has the scans
formatted in 2-page and 1-page format.

## orig0
This contains the original digitization, obtained in 2017 from Thomas Malten.  Malten's staff prepared this
digitization with his guidance.   
This directory also contains several preliminary programmatic refactoring. See the readme.txt therein for details of the steps.
lsr0_works.txt contains the sample texts.
lsr0_refs.txt contains the rest of the digitization (dictionary, notes).

## orig
lsr2.txt contains  lsr0_works.txt, with SLP1 transcoding of Devanagari to
replace the HK (Harvard-Kyoto) transcoding of the original digitization.
lsr2_deva.txt shows the text in Devanagari, so it should be directly
comparable to the Devanagari of the scanned images.
