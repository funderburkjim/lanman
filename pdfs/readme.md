The 'LSR-sanskritreaderw00lanm.pdf' file was received from Thomas Malten in 2017 and
is the particular edition used with his digitization.

Based on the name, it is believed to have come from archive.org.

The 'sanskritreaderw00lanm_bw' is a version of the same document, also obtained from archive.org, in 2020.
Sampada Savardekar Parker closely compared the two versions and the two versions are believed to be scans of the same printed book.
